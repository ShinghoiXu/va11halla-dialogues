2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'even-... Gil?
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, hey guys!"
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,How the hell did you get in?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I have a copy of the key, remembe-..."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Wait, that's how you greet me after so many days?!"
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I never doubted you'd be fine.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"If anything, I'd have to cut your paycheck for leaving for so many days without notice."
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"See, Jill? ""He'll be here on Monday like nothing ever happened."""
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, why does he have a copy of the key and I don't?"
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The need for you having a key never arose.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,True...
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Anyway. Glad you're fine Gil.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thanks. I guess...
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What? Are you gonna make me wash the bathrooms again?
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not today.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Listen, I don't know who the hell you really are or what's trying to come back to bite you in the ass."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But remember there are people that actually care about you. Don't just leave like you did.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Especially after all hell broke loose. At least give us a sign that you're still alive.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So you were worried?
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Isn't that normal?
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"When it comes to you, I don't know."
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"She's right, though. You shouldn't make ladies worry so much."
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Check if the cats didn't move the internet antenna, would you?"
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Fine, fine..."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Boss, why did you leave the hoodie at my place?"
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Because it's yours?
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I told you you could keep it.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Sorry, I... couldn't find it in myself to take it."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Partly because I didn't feel right taking it.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,But mostly because I thought you'd totally look cute with it.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I see...
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Don't think I'm rejecting a gift of yours, it's just..."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Preserving cuteness is one of my principles.
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Um... Boss, about last night..."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think I said one too many things and... uh...
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,So what? Drunk banter is something you see every day. It's not like I'm gonna think less of you because of it.
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Relax, if anything I feel closer to you after seeing you so wasted."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"So yeah, don't give it much thought."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,*snicker* Stupid meat rods.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Antenna's fine. Did I miss anything?
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nothing, let's go."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Are you okay? Your face is red.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'M FINE.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you still worried about the whole bar closure thing?
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course I am.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not like I can't work because of it, but you know..."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,All we can do is enjoy whatever time we have left here as best we can.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah...
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"So, cheer up! Clients smell sadness and fear, and we don't want that."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll go to my office.
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Antenna's fine. Did I miss anything?
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not really, no."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, let's start the day."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, Gil?"
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm?
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Glad to see you're fine. I mean it.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thanks.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Excuse me, I'm looking for Dana Zane."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,May I have your name?
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Tell her it's Brian.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just a sec.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,BOSS!! SOME BRIAN GUY IS LOOKING FOR YOU!!
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,TELL HIM I'LL BE THERE IN A BIT!!
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She'll... um... you heard her.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,It's alright. I'll wait.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's weird for someone to come asking for her though.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,It's not so weird when you're BTC's Regional Manager in these parts.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I guess that's..."
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...um.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess I didn't give you the best first impression.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Haha! Don't worry, I know who I'm dealing with."
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,I'm not a fan of people treating me too nicely because of my position anyways.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Handle me like I'm just another client.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A-Alright. I can do that.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What can I get you, Mr. Brian?"
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Let's go with the basics. A Sugar Rush, please."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Yeah, this one's nice."
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back in training, they made a big deal out of Sugar Rushes. Why?"
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,They're like the Fried Eggs of mixing drinks.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"They're the most basic thing, but people can still mess them up."
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Sugar Rushes are simple enough that you only need to follow instructions.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"If you can't even do that, your future as a bartender is not bright."
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh... they never told me that.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Hm...
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,We've received reports of some CaliCOMPs suffering a bug where the names of the orders don't match up with the recipe.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Are you getting that too by any chance?
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think...?
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"You're Jill, right?"
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yup, that's me."
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Dana has talked quite a bit about you.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"And I guess you must have a few questions for me, am I right?"
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Mostly concerning the closure warning Valhalla got.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can you disclose any information?
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"I shouldn't, but you have the right to know."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Don't mention it. Now where to start...
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"You saw the news on the information leaked during the Apollo Trust Bank incident, right?"
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About the White Knights having lots of members from criminal organizations in their ranks?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Turns out the White Knights weren't the only ones with shady people.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Some of those same folks have been trying to elude legal problems using BTC-certified bars.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"The BTC bars have their own protocols, meaning the White Knights can't dig too deeply..."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"...at least, not without going through a ton of paperwork first, giving the criminals time to cover their tracks."
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Although it takes a bit of time to set up, it has apparently proven an effective method for money laundering."
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where does Valhalla come in?
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"""Young"" bars are the ones under the radar right now, and the modest-to-low income ones are the primary suspects."
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,It's not just Valhalla. Any small bar with small income is being investigated heavily right now.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So the closure notice is due to low sales...
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Among the reasons a bar can get axed, low sales is the rarest one."
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"If low sales were a problem, lots of bars would close every year."
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""You'll find out soon enough"" huh..."
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Sorry?
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, nothing. Don't mind me."
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Seems your guess was spot-on, Gil."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm?
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"If it helps, I'm doing my best to appeal in your place."
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? Why?
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Most of Glitch City's bars are a pain in the ass. They constantly give reports of chemical damage or shady drinks.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,This is one of the few places from which I almost never receive complaints.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,The closest thing to a recent complaint was that whole Farmer Fabrics affair from a little while ago.
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So much saliva...
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,I wouldn't get my hopes up though.
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Especially since the BTC will try to save face by axing as many suspects as possible.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Knowing you're making an effort is enough. Thanks.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything else?
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Now that I remember, the recipe book has a drink created here, right?"
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, the Suplex."
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Get me one of those, please."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,The registry form said this was an accident while making a Piledriver.
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can ask the creator of the drink just over there.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Ah, so you're Robert?"
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yes! That's my name. I'm Robert, the one and only."
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Jill called you ""Gil"" though."
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh... it's Argentinian slang.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"R-Robert here is from Argentina, so we call him Gil."
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Huh... I see.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"No, I think you got it wrong. The Suplex is a variation of a Piledriver."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,This is just a Piledriver.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're right, sorry."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,It happens to even the best of us. Let's leave it at that.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Jill... this isn't...
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Oh well, leave it at that."
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Sorry Brian, I was sorting some stuff at the office. Please come in."
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,I'll be right there.
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Any other questions, Jill?"
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not really, no."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Although...
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Yeah?
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you were to evaluate my performance right now, how would you rate me?"
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Clean and timely delivery of the correct orders. A top-notch bartender.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Now if you'll excuse me...
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"You could use a bit more practice to not mix up one drink with another, but you're pretty good aside from that."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Now, I need to go talk to your Boss. Excuse me."
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Eh... I need to talk to your Boss, excuse me."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'm surprised you haven't met him before.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I received my training in another city. The regional supervisor there was some girl with a red mohawk.
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah, I see."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder what Boss will talk to Brian about...)
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Um... Jill, was it?"
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Miss Stella, what a pleasure."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay?
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah... um... just call me Stella. And get me a big Beer, please."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh... Sure, on it."
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A-Are you sure you're fine?
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...um.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You know Sei, right?"
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Of course, what's up with her?"
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,She was at the Apollo Trust Bank during that whole affair and...
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Right... that.)
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So she...?
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She didn't show up on the list of the massive body count in the aftermath, so..."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I was hoping that maybe you've seen her.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,As much as I'd love to say that I had...
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, I figured as much."
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, the air is suddenly a lot heavier.)"
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I mean, I could tell her everything will be alright, but that would sound a bit... condescending.)"
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(*sigh* What does one do in this kind of situation?)
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Maybe a joke? Nah, that'd be tasteless.)"
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Okay, just... try and say anything. At the very least, you'll break the tension.)"
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Maybe distracting her will be enough?)
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I don't think clearly when under this kind of pressure, do I?)"
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh... there was a private eye here the other day.
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,EYE?!
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"...sorry, I'm a bit on edge."
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"A private detective, I take it?"
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. Maybe you'll want his services?
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What's his name?
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I believe it was Art... Van, no. Von Delay."
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Oh, that Art guy. Yeah, I actually hired him yesterday to look for Sei."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you still have hope.
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm somewhere between Bargaining and Depression right now. And I'm afraid to let go of Bargaining.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is he any good?
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"He doesn't look like it, but he's quite skilled at gathering intel."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I believe he'll give me answers about Sei... whatever they might be.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* Sometimes I wish I had a magic wand so I could solve all my problems with a swing, you know?"
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sorry if I'm making you uncomfortable.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, sorry. No, it's not about feeling uncomfortable."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's just... weird. I usually try to say something to my clients when I see them down.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And right now, I can't find any words that don't sound hypocritical, useless, or tasteless."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'm glad to know you have that much common sense, at least."
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,All I can do is get you drinks. Can I get you anything else?
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Something sweet. That'll help me calm down a bit.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gladly.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thanks.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems you really like Sei.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I don't have brothers or sisters, and my social interactions are usually strictly business."
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"So Sei's more than a friend to me, she's... she's..."
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, I brought that topic up at a bad time."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*ahem* Don't worry about it.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"As I was saying, she's more than a friend. She's my emotional support, she's someone I can trust wholeheartedly."
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'd say she's like my sister, but siblings usually lack that level of trust."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I have to deal with high-class pricks of every race and upbringing on a daily basis.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"They use a ""business mask"" to hide anything they don't want others to know and I do the same."
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"But with Sei I can be myself, I can do whatever I want and vent all my frustrations."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She's always been there for me, and now she might need me..."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"But here I am, sitting in a bar, making other people do that job because I'm a useless pile of flesh!"
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...sorry about the outburst.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm actually kind of jealous of the level of self-control you're using here.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, I'd be a mess in that situation."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, would you like some fresh air? I'm gonna take my break and you could use some."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well... for a given value of ""fresh""."
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'm fine, thanks."
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, please service Miss Stella while I take my break."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Sure, leave it to me."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm ba-... eh?
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"What would a kid like you know about that, eh?"
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm just giving you the facts as they are.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What happened while I was gone?
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let's see...
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Detective guy comes in, Cat Boomer girl greets him. They start talking..."
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Everything was okay until the girl mentioned Zaibatsu Corp offhand.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"After that, the guy got riled up and started badmouthing it."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oddly enough, he was the only one. She just carried on like it was just a normal conversation."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,While I won't deny Zaibatsu Corp is anything but innocent...
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"When you get down to it, it has enhanced the quality of life here."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, if by enhanced, you mean getting yanked around by a shiny new chain around our necks."
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Can't you see that those big companies don't care about us?
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Why do you think Glitch City is mockingly called ""the guinea pig of the world""?"
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,We're just one big test group for them to use however they want!
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"But then again, I don't expect a kid to understand how hard it was, let alone a rich kid."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"True, I don't know. And true, I have a privilege that clouds my judgement."
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But can you deny that the meddling of Zaibatsu Corp has brought quite a few benefits?
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Like what?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The AI Integration Program they started is making huge advances in the AI department.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Every day, more and more countries are seeing the benefits of recognizing AIs as citizens."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yes, but we also hold the AI Reformation Program."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Meaning that we're also the world's Lilim prison.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,AI went rogue? Transfer it to a delivery drone or ship it to Glitch City.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,That murderer is now delivering your pizza.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Fair point. Although that program HAS proven to have reformed many AIs.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They don't brag about their 88% success rate for nothing.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The city also has a stronger economy.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Zaibatsu Corp's success has made more and more companies bring their products here.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And the gap between classes continues to grow.
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,More companies just mean more people who will plant their feet on your face.
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But it also means more products are being brought to the lower classes.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Stores have 20% more brand variety compared to last year.
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh...
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Zaibatsu Corp's main Medical Research branch has also made lots of discoveries.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"More and more illnesses, previously thought incurable, are being addressed every day."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"It's amazing, for those who can afford them."
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Meanwhile, down here we're experiencing medicine shortages almost every month."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You have a point there.
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Oh, but there are also more jobs. All of the companies coming down here need personnel."
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,So the unemployment rate has gone down by almost 40% this year.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,More jobs? Shut up.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Am I wrong?
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, that's..."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Hey you! Don't just sit there. Give me a Zen Star!
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"God, this is awful."
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's your order, though."
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Hey, this tastes better than I expected."
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Because it's not the right order.
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Huh...
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I seriously hope you don't really believe everything you just said.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Of course I do, why else would I say it?"
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You do bring up something I always fail to remember. All the benefits we've gained over time are limited to a few.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I can talk about advances all I want, but in the end, they're still a luxury belonging only to a few."
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And even those that can be accessed by everyone are more like an improvement in the bigger picture.
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,That doesn't take away the fact that there have been positive changes.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Credit where credit's due, don't you think?"
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a... pretty mature answer.
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Discussions are a way for two parties to understand each other.
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The only people afraid of discussion are the ones whose points are too fragile to defend against someone.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, mature. Whatever."
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm gonna take the chance to ask you about that job I gave you yesterday.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I haven't been able to find much, but I can at least tell you that she wasn't at the bank when it opened up."
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What does that mean?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Either she left before the whole ordeal started...
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...or she managed to escape at some point before the whole thing ended.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"All the corpses are accounted for. They only found one totally disfigured, but witnesses identified it."
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"It wasn't your friend, that much is for sure."
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...I see.
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you call him here?
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"No, he just so happened to come here today."
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,The weird part is that the girl did enter the bank. It's like she... vanished or something.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I see. Thanks, keep it up."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your face brightened a bit.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hope is the last thing you lose, I guess."
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"If he's telling the truth, Sei might have found a way out."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,She's a resourceful girl. She surely did something.
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I think I'll have another drink. Do you want anything?
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Me? Um...
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Just get me whatever you order.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Two Bad Touches, please."
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfft* On it.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I remember this one party I went to. The guy that came up with the name of this drink showed up.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"After people found that one out, they lined up to slap him for whatever reason."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They didn't seem offended to me though.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Imagine a guy shows up and tells you ""I made a classy Bad Touch"", wouldn't you line up to slap him?"
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Um... are you okay, Jill?"
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm... f-f-fahahahahahaine...
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Alright, I'll take it."
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,What?!
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What? Do you want a girl that could easily be your daughter to give you a Bad Touch?
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Very classy, Mr. Von Delay."
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Wrong drink, Jill."
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Maybe it's for the best though. Every time I order Bad Touches, I end up in a cycle of bad jokes."
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now that I think of it, did you find that girl you were looking for a week ago, Mr. Von Delay?"
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Turns out she was at the Apollo Trust Bank all this time. No wonder I couldn't get in touch with her.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Girl?
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Someone paid me to look for Crimson Rose and she happened to be at the...
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Um...
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What?
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'm trying to avoid mentioning that a dangerous assassin got stuck in the same bank as the girl you're looking for.
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Oh, don't worry."
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Besides, the last thing I'm worried about with Sei is people."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why's that?
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Her attitude is usually so laid back and gentle that she has no problem getting people on her side.
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And on the off-chance that she has to defend herself... well...
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I once saw her take care of a warbot gone haywire by herself.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She did need medical help afterwards, but she recovered in no time AND managed to take care of the 'bot."
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is she really that good?
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She's not only really physically fit, she's also really good with Krav Maga and..."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something wrong?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"No, nothing. I just realized I forgot about all that."
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Sei's not invincible, but she knows how to take care of herself."
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"And like I said, she's resourceful. She surely found a way out."
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*sigh* I just hope she's well wherever the hell she is.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...she owes me an ice cream.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You want another drink, Mr. Von Delay? It's on me."
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Are you sure?
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, order away."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Okay then. I'll have a Piano Man.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And you, Ms. Stella?"
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm fine. Get his order.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,So this is what drinking something classy without worrying about the price feels like.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,This is sweeter than I imagined.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,That's because you got a woman instead of a man.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Just like when my daughter was born.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,This is different from what I remember.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Because that's not a musician at all.
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Alright, I should get going. My contact will arrive at the rendezvous point soon."
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I'll let you know if I find out anything else, Ms. Hoshii."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Please do.
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Right, then."
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've been generous today.
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He made my night with his discoveries on Sei's situation.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'm not totally over it, but at least I got distracted for a bit."
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, that's it for me. Good night, Miss Hoshii."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thanks again.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You don't mind if I stay a bit longer, right?"
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why would I? It's not like you're asleep.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thanks. This place is... soothing.
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'll just go sit over there near the arcades.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Alright then. That would be all, Dana."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Quite a mess, the situation with... um... Robert."
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Brian, you have a meeting in an hour with MI-6 Hall-C."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Right, right..."
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Oh! If it isn't Miss Hoshii herself.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Ah, Brian. Fancy meeting you here."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,I didn't expect to see you here of all places.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Are you busy? Mind catching up for a bit?
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Sure, no problem."
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Jill, we'll be sitting over here."
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me know if you need anything.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Will do.
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cass,"This holophone is an old model, so hanging up is a bit laggy."
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cass,You can call me Cass by the way.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I'm Jill.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Say... you guys give a lot of liberties to my boss.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, she gets away with too much stuff."
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cass,"She's not hurting anyone, and wouldn't you say it's more interesting that wa-..."
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It finally hung up.)
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I think I've had enough for today.
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How are you feeling?
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Better than when I came in at the very least.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thank you for everything.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm ba-... eh?
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where's Miss Stella?
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,She left saying she had something to do.
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hope she's fine.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Mister Art."
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Mister Art... that sounds weird.
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'll have a Beer.
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Beer.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,There's no better way to end a crappy day at work.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bad day?
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Not really, just that my job's crappy in general."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah.
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,What is this? An unwashed glass that used to have Beer and that you poured water on?
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not that far from the truth actually.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Listen, even I know this isn't a Beer. Not paying!"
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You sure look happy for someone that was aggravated.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Wait, did you just say ""Miss Stella""?"
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"When you entered, you asked for Miss Stella."
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Would it happen to be Stella Hoshii?
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That one, yeah."
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Huh... that was quite the coincidence. I'm actually doing a job for her.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's more of a coincidence that it happens to be the Stella you're looking for.
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"""Stella"" is not exactly a common name. So of course I'll raise an eyebrow when hearing it."
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of job are you doing for her?
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Tracking some missing girl that was in the Apollo Trust Bank on the weekend.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you find her?
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,That's the weirdest thing. She wasn't among the dead bodies and yet she is nowhere to be found.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I like to think she found a way out, but I must keep investigating."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Speaking of searches, did you find the other girl you were looking for?"
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Crimson Rose? Nope, but I did find out she was stuck with the other people at the Apollo Trust Bank."
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She disappeared too, and honestly, she better stay that way."
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"There are things I certainly don't wanna deal with, and an assassin whose cover has been blown is one of them."
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder what she was doing there.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,That girl is... unstable. Crazy.
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Saying ""She was there because she found the idea of being in a soon-to-be murdered crowd FUN"" isn't far fetched."
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you're saying this girl is on the run?
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Apparently not only is she hurt, she also got her cover blown."
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,A wounded beast on the run. Something I'm seriously not getting involved with.
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I don't care how much they offer me.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"On a side note, get me a Marsblast, please."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Marsblast? On it.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You sure this is right? This isn't red.
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The Marsblast isn't red, I still don't get that one either."
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You sure this is a Marsblast? It's a tad... sweet.
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The Marsblast isn't red, and I think you were expecting a red drink, so..."
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Ah, I see."
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"...you're weird, kid."
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"This isn't a Marsblast, Miss Bartender."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Don't expect me to pay for it.
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Try to say it without a smile at least.)
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're blowing your money quite lightly. At least compared to the last time you came.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You remember the last time I came?
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We don't get that many clients, so it's easy to remember."
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, well. I have to."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I don't want the client to come back looking for their cash when they realize I'm not looking for Crimson Rose.
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You aren't?
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Do you know how Crimson Rose kills her targets?
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not really, no."
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Her blood has an abnormal batch of nanomachines.
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"They react to the ""normal"" kind floating inside you and I."
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"If her blood touches yours, it causes nanomachine rejection almost immediately."
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Right then and there, spreading as fast as your blood pumps."
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Tissues getting ripped off by themselves... brain damage...
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She never executes her targets. She just cuts them, cuts her palm and holds the target's injury tightly."
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Some say the target looks like it's getting drained. Getting thinner by the minute.
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Like I said, as far as I know, that girl's cover got blown during the whole bank affair."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,She got crazy with bloodlust and killed a guy or something.
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"When everyone was freed, she just disappeared, probably until the smoke blows off."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And there're also hints that she got some sort of injury.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,So she's likely going to be more on guard than usual.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And do you honestly think I wanna chase someone so dangerous in such a situation? I'm not an idiot.
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"If my client wants someone dead, they can get someone else to take the contract. I have a family, dammit."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You do?
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Wife and a daughter, why?"
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know. You strike me more as a single person, for some reason."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I get that a lot.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Alright, one last drink before leaving."
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything on your mind?
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Hm... a Piano Man or something with lots of alcohol, I'll let you decide."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,A Piano Man...
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Now that I think about it, why don't you have a pianist? That would bring clients."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The problem isn't the pianist. Pianos are just too expensive.
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,This Piano Man seems off.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's um... actually a woman.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, the drink can identify itself however it wants, I won't judge."
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yup, just like this."
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why order something so strong?
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I've had this headache for a bit and I wanted to see if alcohol would calm it.
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And?
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,No luck
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Thank god I'm leaving...
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Aight... tiiiiiiiiime to leave.
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Whatcha lookin' at?
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not moving.
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Bullshit! I'm moving, you're moving, the damn floor is moving like crazy."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'm just waiting for it to take me out the door.
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Riiiiiight, I'm gonna call you a cab."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hello? Yeah, it's me."
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,His name? Art Von Dela-... hello?
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They hung up.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Was it Tanhausser Cabs? Yeah, I'm banned from their services."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Too big of a tab, I'd always get into one of their cabs and then jump out of the window to avoid having to pay."
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Don't worry. I'll just go to my office and sleep it off. It's nearby.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, yeah..."
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Alright then, I'll just take my leave now."
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Weird that you didn't ask for information or anything.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Right now, I don't need anything like that. Otherwise I would've been pestering you from the moment I entered."
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see. Careful out there.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, yeah..."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Phew, it's been quite the day."
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At least the streets are calm today.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I have... *wheeze* arrived yet again at the *cough* oh god... at the majestic hall of heroes.
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Calm until now.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"We meet again, bartender."
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You look winded, Virgilio."
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's pronounced Veer-HEE-rio.
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I'm pretty sure it's Virgilio. You said as much the last time you came."
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Pronunciations are a silly thing society imposes on letters.
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,They want to be free! They want to be pronounced however they want.
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You look winded, Virgilio."
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,We are all little toys winded by the cruel hand of fate.
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Just stumbling until it decides not to wind us anymore.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And yet, you're the only one in the vicinity hyperventilating."
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,That's um... I was jogging.
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Dressed like that?
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I can jog however I want.
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes you can.
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Something fake.
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course.
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,And this is?
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Totally-not-Beer.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ah, yes, just as fake as I want."
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Why is this fake?
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not a blast from the moon, just a drink named like one."
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ah, the moon. In the Tarot, the Moon means ""Dogs will howl in a river""."
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Don't... correct him. Keep your mouth shut.)
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Why is this fake?
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not a blast from a planet, it's just a drink."
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Interesting, very interesting."
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,And why is this fake?
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not a real Gut Punch, no matter how you interpret that phrase."
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Brilliant!
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Now, tell me why this is fake."
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because I didn't even try.
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your expectations of me giving a damn about the abstract order are fake.
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Bra-vo! Brilliant!
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, Virgilio. Where do you work?"
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I take the noble duties of curator at the Steampunk Museum.
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? What do you do?
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I study everything that comes and keep it clean for the people that visit the premises.
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,But lately my duties have been hindered by the museum's owner.
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yeah, he told me, ""Stop touching the exhibits! You're gonna break them."" The nerve of some people."
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Eh?
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,He still fails to realize that I'M the curator there.
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Without me, all those machines would be rustier than they already are."
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Even the visitors get that I'm the one responsible for those, why can't the owner realize that too?!"
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...yeeeeeeah.
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I bet he treats you like a janitor or something like that.
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Exactly!
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Okay then. Time for your next challenge, bartender."
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Challenge, he says..."
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I want purity.
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"How is this... ""pure""?"
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a drink. It's free from any human sin. It can do no harm consciously.
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ah, yes... beautiful."
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Hm?
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Hey you, the guy over there."
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Me?
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yes, you. Have we met before?"
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Can't remember. Maybe?
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yeah, I think..."
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,...
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,...NONONONO. We haven't met. Ever. At all.
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's an interesting reaction.
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Ah Jill, I'll be taking my leave now."
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Be careful out there.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thanks... huh?
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Excuse me, have we met somewhere before?"
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,That face... that eye...
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"What about my eye, punk?!"
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"We haven't met ever at all. Never, ever, ever, ever."
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Good talking to you, bartender."
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...um.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you just scare off a client?
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Apparently.
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Well. I'm off. Thanks for everything.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't mention it.
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"Y-Yes, Dana. Your sister is certainly cute. Can I leave? PLEASE?"
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Fiiiiiiine. We discussed what we had to anyways.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Careful out there.
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,Thank god...
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Brian,"A pleasure meeting you Jill, same to you err... Robert."
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Bartender, if you're done ogling Mr. Holocall Suit, would you mind giving me a drink?"
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, what do you want?"
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I want...
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"To leave! Bye, Bartender!"
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...huh.
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Second time he ran off like that. He's either hiding here or would rather not be found by the police.
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What do you think, Gil?"
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I know nothing of it.
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course you don't.
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are we done for the day?
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yup, quite a few clients considering the whole situation."
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,OH SHIT! That Virgilio guy...
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you two actually met before?
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yeah, you could say that."
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What? What?
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil stuff. Don't mind it.
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What were you talking about to Brian?
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Well...
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"We were mostly catching up, to be honest."
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I hadn't seen him in a while. I offered him a drink when we met last week.
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I talked a bit about what to do after the bar closes.
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Oh! And I tried to... uh... explain the situation with... Robert here.
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He agreed to help me out with that one when the time comes.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah.
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Oh...
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I was also tuning up the details for the new employee.
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,New employee?
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"A part-timer, you'll meet him tomorrow."
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"""Him""? So it's a guy?"
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"An adorable guy, if I do say so myself."
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...I suddenly have deja vu.)
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Are you alright, Jill?"
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah.
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It must be nothing.)
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(God damn, is it chilly outside.)"
