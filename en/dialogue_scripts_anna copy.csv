2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Fore, leave Gaby alone. Let her sleep."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Happy new year!
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I said... Happy. New. Year!
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,*ahem* I said... HA-
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I heard you the first time.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Then answer the first time, would you? Don't be rude."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You trespass into my house and I'm the rude one?
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I didn't trespass, I just showed up here."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's trespassing.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Trespassing implies passing. I just appeared here, thus there was no passing."
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And how exactly did you do that?
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Oh, hey! You're talking to me directly!"
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't change the subject!
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'm so happy you're not pulling that whole telepath crap.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're the one being a telepath.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But I can't read minds. I can read words, however."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, what I mean is that I'm not the one reading thoughts, so I'm not..."
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Agh, forget it."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why are you here?
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I wanted to wish you a happy new year.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you were bored.
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Being bored has nothing to do with me wishing you happy holidays.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But it helps.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I won't deny that.
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Still, you deserve some congratulations, Jo!"
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You closed off an old chapter of your life and grew as a person!
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"That always deserves some cheers. In fact, let's make a toast."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Mind if I grab a Beer?
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I do, actually. I don't wanna clean beer off the floor."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You don't know if that's what'll happen.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Trust me, I know."
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,But the to-o-o-o-oast...
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's the thought that counts, let's leave it at that."
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Fine, sheesh."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Oh! Hey kitty!
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder if Fore can see you.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"With cats, you never know..."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"He might see me, or he might be seeing an interesting speck of dust."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey Jo, let's play a game."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of game?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Truth or truth.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't you mean Truth or Dare?
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"No, dares with me wouldn't be too fun, I'm guessing."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,We ask questions to each other and we can't lie.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You'll even get your ever-so-precious dialogue choices! Ain't that nice?
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The what now?
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I'm thinking out loud, don't mind me."
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you keep your word on that?
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I don't lie.
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...fine, I'll play with you."
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Great! You start.
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just... what are you?
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,A cute girl!
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's not what I meant.
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, I'm also from a Catholic family, although I'm not religious."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not what I meant either.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'm also very gay and like girls a lot.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I should've figured you wouldn't take the question seriously.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Yeah, but did you think that maybe those are the answers I have?"
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,There're things I know about myself.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Why I am like this, is not one of those things."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I got out of the hospital, got hit by something and here I am."
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Why I'm in this state... hell if I know.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sorry if I sounded rude.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"You were just your charming usual self, Jo."
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well then, my turn. Do you like your boss?"
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I do.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"No, do you like, LIKE your boss?"
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Mhm.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Both of you go to a romantic dinner. The mood is right.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Do you say you love her?
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"The mood escalated! You're both nude in a room, do you have sex?"
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Why so hesitant all of a sudden?
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because you took me off-guard.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"No, that's not it..."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Jo, do you really like your boss like that?"
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I do...
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Ok, let's say you have the chance to have sex with Blondie Sweaterpups."
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'd do it.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Do you see the hesitation now?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...I can't believe you just have a teen crush on your boss.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not a...
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"You like her and love her, but hesitate at the thought of fucking."
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You admire her and want her with you but won't go deeper.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's called friendship.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Edging on teen crush.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Let's move on to the next question before you shortcircuit.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, how much of your story is true?"
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"It depends on what you mean by ""my story""."
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A couple of weeks back, when you showed up the first time at the bar."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That whole hospital thing, how much of that is true?"
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,How much do you think is true?
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's not an answer.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I could say ""all of it"", but I could be lying."
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Truth depends on either facts or trust.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"And since that question shows a lack of trust, there're only facts left."
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I believe you have enough facts to form yourself an opinion of what's true.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Your lack of trust hurts me Jo. I really like you.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just ask your question.
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,What will you do after the bar closes?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've been looking into the other bar Boss told me about.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's a bit far, but I can manage."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Let me rephrase the question a bit.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Do you plan on being a bartender the rest of your life?
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Is this your calling?
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"The bar closing is the chance to retake your life, to do whatever you want."
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't you have any dreams to follow?
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And are you okay with that? Not knowing?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yes, actually."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Oh?
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My biggest regrets arose from those worries.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I've come to realize that running directionless is worse.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What's more, I've been doing fine just managing things one at a time."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So that's what I'll do until I know what I wanna do.
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You do know I'm the one hearing you and acting cool amounts to nothing.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Whatever.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I get to ask something now, right?"
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Yup.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, why am I the only one that can see you?"
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't be so pretentious. You're not the only one that can see me.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You're the only one among the people close to you.
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, why?"
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Beats me, I don't even know why I'm like this."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I do have a theory though.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Maybe the ones that can see me are the ones I wish could see me.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"The day I entered the bar, I thought you were cute."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Maybe I wanted you to see me so hard that you were able to.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"It was hard to contain my surprise, to be honest."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I've tried to get some people to see me, but maybe something holds me back."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you make those things happen with your mind?
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It's still a theory. I don't have any solid basis for these speculations.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I mean, Beth could see me, so..."
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who's Beth?
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,A very nice girl.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Speaking of nice girls, what's so cool about your boss?"
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,What makes you all giddy about her?
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, she's so... strong, you know?"
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not only physically, but mentally too!"
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's steadfast, reliable, charismatic, fun to be with..."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's everything I'm not, she makes you feel safe while you're with her."
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, how can you not see it?!"
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I haven't spent enough time with her, I guess."
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Jeez, you got pretty excited there."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you have any hobbies?
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Do not talk about me in past tense.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* do you have any hobbies?
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, back when I had a solid body I liked tabletop games."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Yeah, like the one where you push someone on it, raise her legs and..."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's one weird way of playing Monopoly.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Anything for Athena Avenue.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,The only things I remember I liked doing were pranks.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No shit.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It's so fun to see how people react to them.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"The setup, the deception, the payoff... it's like art."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I did have some limits though.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"If I know something would make someone cry, it's out of the question."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"If it puts them in any risk, it's out of the question."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"And if it causes trouble to too many outsiders, it's out of the question."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That sounds... sensible.
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Of course, pranks are no good if only the prankster has fun with them."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Then you're just a bully.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any prank you regret doing?
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,In elementary school I hid a bee in a boy's backpack... he was allergic.
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Nothing terrible happened, but... yeah."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,My turn then!
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,How was the party? I was busy.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You? Busy?
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I can be busy.
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I mean, I saw you get your big moment and talk about cucumbers..."
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*cough*
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,But that was a break from other stuff I was doing.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is this here another break?
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,This is a well-earned rest.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good for you.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The party was fun, not a crazy thing, just a chill time."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Food, drinks and friends... and a couple of dogs."
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss almost burned the place down setting off her ""totally legal fireworks""."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil brought his girlfriend, and I still can't believe who she was."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Dorothy brought some acquaintances too. Really nice people... if a bit gaudy.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alma and I...
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,What? You and Sweaterpups WHAT?!
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nothing, I just realized how nice it felt to say I have friends."
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Holy shit, that's some corny-ass line right there."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's true though.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's the first time the friendship has felt... real.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There're people I can trust, people that trust me."
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,People I can get invested into outside my family.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's such an awesome feeling...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Like I said, that's god damn cheesy."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"...that said, am I your friend, Jo?"
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe? Give it more time.
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Heheh...
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"...no, but seriously. You and Sweaterpups did what?"
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take pics.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,BOOOOORING.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Were they nudes?
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING.
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well then, next question."
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what do you like?"
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Girls. Boys are icky.
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not a wrong answer, but not the one I was looking for."
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"So, likes in general?"
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Mhm.
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Well...
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I like pizza with lots of mushrooms.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I like stockings that go up to the thigh.
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I like long hair even though I prefer to have it short.
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I like small animals, but I like really big ones more."
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I REALLY like flowery perfumes.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I don't like stuffed animals, as weird as it sounds."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I like tall girls, or at least those taller than me."
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I also like the smell of freshly cut grass.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I like the sound of a cat's purr.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I like to laugh and to make people laugh.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"And of course, I like you or I wouldn't be here."
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a concise list.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Speaking of likes, do you like what you see?"
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...come again?
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Do you like what you see? If you saw me on the street, would you hit on me?"
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I doubt it.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,That's a lie and you know it.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wouldn't.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Liar, I'm hot."
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nobody's denying that, but I wouldn't."
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Why not?!
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For starters, I'm not one to hit on strangers."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let alone hit on a girl in a fucking sailor uniform.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Like you wouldn't fuck a girl in a sailor uniform.
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you mean....
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I mean that in any way that phrase could be taken as.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Let me rephrase this then...
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Would I be able to make you look at me so hard you couldn't avert your gaze?
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes. Happy?
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I am.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"So much in fact, that I'll let you ask something else."
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you have any regrets?
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't we all?
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any in particular that come to mind? Stuff you really wanna fix?
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...my mom.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"My dad left, so when I died, I was worried about leaving her by herself."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Luckily, then came Becky."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"*sigh* But then, Becky feared she might be hurting my mom with her presence."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I guess I have to thank you for that.
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Becky fixed her relationship with my mom.
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Lanette's mom was able to close her chapter too.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And it was all thanks to you speaking with her.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not a big deal.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But yeah, with Becky being closer to my mom, I can't think of anything else."
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Just the usual scars, the stuff we use to grow up."
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,The things we can't fix...
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"...say, Jo. Did you lie to that Gaby girl?"
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About what?
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"About staying with her, how you wouldn't leave her alone and all that."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I didn't.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"She's asleep, she can't hear me. You can be honest with me."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, I'll tell you the truth."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Hm?
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just between us...
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I didn't lie.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Heh.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The time I spent with Lenore was also time I spent with Gaby.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Since Lenore was pretty much the one that raised her, she was always there."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We'd play, read together, watch TV..."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, she felt like a little sister... or a daughter."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But one of the things that hurt me the most when Gaby reappeared was her hate.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...it's never nice when the one you love suddenly hates you with reason.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So yeah, why the hell would I lie about that?"
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It's a relief to hear that.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"She's cute, she'll grow into a fine lady."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Was her sister as cute?
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lenore was in a league of her own.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Something I must see then.
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Any other questions?
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how long will you keep fucking with me?"
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I don't know, we haven't even started. You wanna?"
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can you do anything in your current state?
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Finding out would be half the fun, wouldn't you say?"
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Fucking with me, pestering me, appearing out of the blue here."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you keep doing that?
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I can answer that, but first I need you to answer something."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Do you hate me, Jo?"
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Isn't this like the third time you've asked this?
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Then maybe I haven't gotten a clear answer.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You made me spill some drinks that were discounted from my paycheck.
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You still sore about that?
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I really wanted curry that week and the stunt left me broke.
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's also the fact that your jokes made a fool out of me too many times.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not to mention that your existence is mind-breaking.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're a hallucination, then I'm going mad and that's no good."
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're not, then that opens a whole new can of worms."
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're a ghost, then science has to rethink where it's going."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're... something else, then what? How? Why?"
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not to mention you turn anything into innuendo and might be too horny.
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Go on...
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But... I have no reason to hate you.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your demeanor is no different from many other regulars of the bar.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hell, talking to you is fun... in a really messed up way."
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't feel like your actions come from trying to be mean, and you're cute."
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So yeah, I don't hate you."
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, to answer your question. Yes! I will keep bugging you."
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can you at least keep it here instead of the bar?
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Then I wouldn't be doing a good job of bugging you, right?"
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Glad to know you don't hate me!
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"It's fun to be around you, and I'd get sad if I annoyed you that much."
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't push your luck though.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, let's get this over with..."
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Your next words will be ""Do you watch me masturbate?"""
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you watch... me... the fuck?
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,That question was gonna come up at some point.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And the answer is...
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is...?
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'm building suspense.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just answer.
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,No.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why not?
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I meant that I don't watch you masturbate.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Why do you sound so surprised?
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"With the stuff you say, can you blame me?"
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I have a sense of personal space too, you know?"
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And there's a line between pestering and being an asshole.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Not that I'd be against the idea of watching you, mind you."
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Should that flatter me?
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Take it as you will.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'm surprised you believe me though.
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At one point I just gave up and started taking you as you come.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you didn't start suddenly joking about how you watch me masturbate...
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That means it's something you wouldn't joke about and thus not lie.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"You've been thinking about that question for a long time, haven't you?"
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, to ask something in the same vein..."
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Let's say you have the chance to have sex with any person you want.
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,One night of action until your body crumbles.
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Who do you pick?
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Your boss?
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder...
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Blondie Sweaterpups?
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please be quiet for a second.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"It's not the riddle of the sphinx, Jo."
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess I'd pick...
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you ever heard of an actress named Glo-ri-a?
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Oh my god.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You too?!
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I've been a huge fan of Glo-ri-a for a long time.
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"She's such a talented actress, such a charismatic person."
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But more importantly, she's hot as all hell!"
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Still is, thank God she didn't prune like other actresses do."
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'm surprised you'd pick her over everyone else.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, if I could pick anyone, might as well pick someone I don't even know."
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Yet.
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yet?
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"You might get to know her, you never know."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"True, I got to know an idol after all."
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... have you met anyone else in your state?
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,My state?
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A ghost.
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I ain't no ghost.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Poltergeist, imp, brat. You know what I mean."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Hey...
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I've met many rarities in my current state.
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Like this weird thing I keep seeing popping up in my field of view.
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It flies everywhere and sometimes tries to touch me indecently.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But someone like me? No, not yet."
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Although considering I don't even know why I am like this...
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Who knows, I might've met someone already."
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"The closest thing is that brat, I guess, but..."
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"...can't think of anyone, no."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You do know dropping vague pronouns like that is annoying, right?"
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I'm just thinking out loud, don't think too much about it."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"If you wanna think about something, what are your new year resolutions?"
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I have none.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"That can't be right, everyone has new year resolutions!"
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It's the only thing that reminds people that they want to be better.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Even if they don't do any of the stuff they say they will.
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But it's the wish, the intention that counts!"
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...yup, can't think of any."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Lose weight?
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm fine.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Quit smoking?
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hell no.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Speak more with your parents?
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm good.
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Make this cat lose weight?
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He...  hm... that sounds like a good goal.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,I wholeheartedly disagree.
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Oh?
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...crap.
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Did you just...?
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I did nothing.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You just pretended your cat talked.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did not.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You did!
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Quiet.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, you're yawning."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I sure as hell ain't boring, so it must be because of the hour."
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'll let you be... for now.
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hey Anna.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... you have a happy new year too.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And if you wanna bother me, I do get bored in here from time to time."
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh... yeah... that.
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You called me by my name!
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On second thought...
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't be like that.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I'll take your offer and pester you some more later.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hell, I'll do it even if you say nothing!"
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Oh dear...
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey Jo, can you open the door for me?"
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just disappear like how you came in.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Come on, humor me."
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fine...
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Thank you.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Bye Jo.
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sometimes I wonder if this is a sign to stop drinking.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,"""Fore"": Are you drunk now?"
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bit.
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Truth is such a weird thing.
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,It can change as you learn more and more facts.
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,But what if those facts change? What if the facts get tampered with?
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Do you trust the source of your facts?
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Is that trust keeping you blind from the truth?
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Truth and trust are always tied together.
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And it's with that in mind that I give you this advice.
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"From now on, if you want the truth..."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...you'll have to trust me.
