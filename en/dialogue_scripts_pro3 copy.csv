2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You look bummed, Boss."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Starting tomorrow, there will be no more Corgis in our bar. Why wouldn't I be sad?"
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Maybe because starting tomorrow, there will be no more Corgis at the bar.)"
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...I wonder if the Shiba Appreciation Society might be interested in booking us.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"One problem at a time, Boss."
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Wait, I know someone from the Pomeranian Development Institute!"
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,ONE PROBLEM AT A TIME!!
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, you've been tense ever since Friday. Are you worried about Gil or something?"
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Trust me. Of all my worries, Gil is the least of them."
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Put on some music and enjoy the day, won't you?"
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Bartender, we meet again."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... Ms. Betty.
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Hello.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And Mr. Corgi Lover.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Call me Deal.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Deal.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Deal?
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Deal.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...wipe that satisfied look off your faces, you two."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem* What can I serve you today?
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'll have a Beer.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'm not the designated driver today, so... give me a Fringe Weaver."
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...alright, coming right up."
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thanks.
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thank you.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thanks.
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Something's not right here.
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thank you.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,There's something wrong here. My drink.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,This doesn't seem right.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You too?!
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You seem distracted.
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Has serving so many dogs finally gotten to you?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No... well. Yeah. But it's not that.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My boss has been acting weird since Friday.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Weird how?
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Romantic weird? Drug-addict weird? Let's-hope-nobody-finds-the-body-in-the-fridge weird?
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For starters, there's the fact she only told me we were being booked moments before we opened."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Plus, she seems completely distracted or lost in her thoughts."
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Like you.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Worse.
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Oh...
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's not being herself, and that makes me wonder if something's going on."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Like what? Do you run a human trafficking ring in the basement?
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, we don't have a license for that."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, well. Thinking about it too much is not part of my job."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Can I ask you something about your job?
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I've always been curious. What does the BTC need in their bartenders? What do you need to study?
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They train you from scratch, so you don't have to study anything beforehand."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,What does the training involve?
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's a lot of etiquette and regulation work. Most of our time, though, is actually spent in simulations."
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Simulations?
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Different scenarios involving different chemical hazards. That sort of thing.
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They want you to be able to respond to every possible situation that might come up involving our ingredients.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, the chances for failure are really slim... but it's better to not take those chances."
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I see.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll be back with you guys in a bit. I must attend to the other clients... dogs... that.
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, sure."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,"THEY ARE CHASING ME, MAN!"
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,"THE CABBAGES, MAN! THE GODDAMN CABBAGES!"
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,THEY ARE EVERYWHERE! THEY ARE OUT FOR MY RUMP!!
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your...? Nevermind.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything to calm down?
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,A BIG BLUE FAIRY WOULD BE NICE.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,"THANKS, VERY NICE OF YOU."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,THIS ISN'T THAT BIG.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mister Puff,"THE CABAGGES TOLD YOU TO SERVE ME SOMETHING ELSE, DIDN'T THEY?!"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,*sigh*
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something the matter?
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,Nothing a drink can't solve.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not sure about that, but it's hardly my job to preach sobriety. What do you want?"
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,Give me a Gut Punch.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,Thanks.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,"Hey, you ever felt guilty for being born the wrong race?"
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The what now?
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,I've just been hearing so much about how we're racist. I'm wondering...
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you racist?
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,Not really.
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you feel like other Corgis might be?
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,Definitely. I mean...
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Then, why worry? It's not like they're calling YOU racist."
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You shouldn't take generalizations personally.
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,You might be right...
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Third Barkday,*sigh*
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Well, that made me feel guilty.)"
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Man, you should've seen the cutie I saw yesterday on the way home."
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"She looked like a Cat Boomer. She was wearing a mini-dress, and had this prosthetic eye..."
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I thought you were against people using prosthetics.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'm not against cute, though."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Besides, I'm not against prosthetics. I'm only against enhancements."
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I don't see a difference between the two.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Alright, let me put it this way."
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"If you lost an arm and replaced it with a mechanical arm that does exactly what the older one did, I'm okay with it."
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But if you lost your arm and replaced it with a gun-loaded super arm from hell...
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's something I'm not okay with.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Even worse is if you decide to replace your arm because of fashion, or a whim, or to get better at some sport."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's completely not cool.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That's the difference between a prosthetic and an enhancement. Replacement versus, er, enhancement..."
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm of a similar opinion about Lilim replacing their factory parts for kicks.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"If you think that's going to be an easy way of getting better at something, you're in for a bad surprise."
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I can see why you think that, but... what suggested to you that what she had wasn't an enhancement?"
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"If she had bad eyesight, wouldn't that count as an enhancement? Even if it fixes it?"
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How does reparative work factor into your ideologies?
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"They might be enhancements, but they also replace something faulty."
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Well... uh...
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Dammit. Stop making sense, you piece o' scrap."
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're weakening my resolve.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Having fun?
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, bartender. That was fast."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There seem to be less dogs out today - at least, dogs that want a drink."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah... some of them ate their tickets.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sigh* Lovely. I'll be the one dealing with that later.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Say, what's your take on the whole enhancement discussion, bartender?"
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My mom had a saying: ""Anyone can make a chandelier out of their asses."""
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Which somehow means ""Your body, your choices."""
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If they are not hurting anyone, I don't see the point in hating them."
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"See, Betty?"
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey! I didn't say I automatically hate anyone who has an enhancement.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Me being against something isn't the same as me being against someone.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm not some 12 year old blindingly hating someone because of something like that.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Maybe you should practice what you preach.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,What does THAT mean?
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I fear retaliation, so I'm not saying another word."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you two gonna order anything?
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm fine right now.
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"She's drinking mine, actually."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright. Call if you need anything else.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Sure.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see...
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Ow!
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(So much for avoiding retaliation.)
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,You're not gonna believe me.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,I was in the bathroom and this other dog was looking at me from the top of the sink!
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You mean the mirror?
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,No! Another dog!
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see... what can I serve you?
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,You're not gonna do anything about that other dog on the top of the sink?!
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm sure he doesn't want to hurt anybody. Don't worry.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,I hope you're right...
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,"Well, I want something really sweet."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,Thanks! Please think about the thing with the other dog on top of the sink.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I will, don't worry."
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Poop-eater,"But I didn't want this. You're in cahoots with the dog on top of the sink, aren't you?!"
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who knows...?
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well then...
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That was quick.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Like I said, there aren't too many dogs today."
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When I heard someone booked us for three days, I expected more of an attendance."
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"While you were gone, this fella here said that the Bleeding Jane is better than a Piledriver."
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Please. Prove him wrong.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,All I'm saying is that I don't see the point in drinks that feel more like a kick in the mouth than a beverage.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"What do you think, bartender? Do you think there's any point discussing non-alcoholic drinks in a bar?"
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In my opinion, people who order a Bad Touch always make me giggle like an idiot, though."
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's not an opinion... That's a statement.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, well. Please serve us either Piledrivers or Bleeding Janes. We'll let you decide which one is better."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yes!
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yeah. Take his side. See if I care.
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Jackpot!
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, well..."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No fighting this way, right?"
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Wow, you're quite the softie..."
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Just kidding. Wise choice.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,No complaints here.
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfft* Here.
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And you think this is funny.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I can see why she'd find it funny. Loosen up a bit, Betty."
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"With a couple more of these, maybe I will."
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Taking a third choice, huh?"
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I could've accepted the ""Cut the baby in half"" Solomon thing, but whatever."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did you two end up discussing that?
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, it started when I told this guy that I wasn't as crazy about the idea of working just for Corgis."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Why don't you like Corgis?! They're cute, and fluffy, and funny and they just... like... MAKE YOU SMILE!"
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Tell me one interesting thing about them.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Legends say they were created by a fairy and that their breed was raised to fight dragons.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, you have to be kidding."
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, actually, I heard that one too."
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Really?
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Still, I can't see why you're so tired of them."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Dunno. Maybe because I only ever deal with them at their worst?
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You've only seen them in their ""happy"" state."
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm the one running feces samples and unclogging their sphincters if they eat their owner's dental floss.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I might be their veterinarian, but they treat me more like a mom and not in a good way."
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's like being a gynecologist.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"After a while, you stop seeing boobs and vaginas. Instead, all you see are ISSUES you must fix."
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,At least they are cute issues.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Depends, a gynecologist can't pick clients by age or preferences."
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I was talking about your job.
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Oh. Yeah. That too.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Still, I don't think it's so much that I'm tired of them as it is I'm tired of you being so obsessed with them."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm not obsessed. I'm passionate.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You sleep with a Corgi plushie and have a wall dedicated to photos you've taken at the company.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm really passionate?
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Too much passion can become an issue, you know..."
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Speaking of issues, did you talk with the directors about the whole Cardigan conflict?"
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was going to do that tomorrow when they're all together.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But I still don't see why I should be the one doing it.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"For starters, they don't take me too seriously."
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Understandable. I don't take you seriously either.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I mean, in the end, they're still dogs. They need someone with a strong, commanding voice."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Are you saying I have a naggy voice?
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, not your VOICE. Just your entire demeanor."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So I have a naggy DEMEANOR?
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm assuming you two are talking about the whole race conflict.
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, this is hurting them more than they think. The company might actually collapse at this rate."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Which is terrible, because a couple of these dogs' families are dependent on their paychecks."
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Doesn't that count as unethical and... unusual treatment of animals?
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's a bit of a legal gray area. The dogs are doing it willingly, after all."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And even if they weren't doing it willingly, the dogs aren't actually being mistreated or exploited."
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"In fact, the company's pretty relaxed."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Speaking of relaxed, how's Juergen doing?"
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"He's fine. Still complaining about his back. Still unwilling to take his medicine. He says he's ""not that weak""."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who's this Juergen guy?
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's actually commonplace, isn't it?"
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lilim being unable to leave their guardians because they feel too much like family.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Now, to be fair, people get attached to many things. Some even get obsessed with inanimate objects."
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,My grandpa loved his car more than any of his sons.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"The one whose will left all his earthly possessions to his car, right?"
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, that one."
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How do you become a Lilim's guardian?
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You fill a form at the Artificial Intelligence Council.
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Then, they do a background check. If they deem you useful, they'll give you authorization."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You're given a week's notice before they give you all the data about the Lilim you'll be taking care of.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You'll have to watch over it until it can pass three different personality tests.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"If the Lilim wants to stay with you after that, that's your problem."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, it's like adoption and the lottery all rolled into one."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,They do that to diversify the possible outcomes.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Two Lilim can be of the same model, but they'll grow differently depending on their guardians."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,What if something happens to the guardian?
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"A new guardian can appeal to the council, stating they're more fit for the position than the original."
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,This happens when a guardian has become unavailable in some way...
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...or because you can back up claims of neglect or maltreatment.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You spit out all that information like it's hard-coded in you.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I worked in that department for some time before coming to the STC. It's almost a reflex.
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Are you interested in becoming a guardian, bartender?"
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, I'm just a nerd when it comes to AIs in general."
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The money they give you for it is not that great though.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, time to check on the dogs."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,LISTEN HERE PUNK!
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,"Sorry, I didn't mean to call you a punk. It's just..."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,I WAS CHASING MY TAIL AND NOW I'M TOO HYPER TO CONTROL MYSELF!
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,"Sorry, sorry, sorry..."
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,Just... give me anything.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...alright.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,"...whew, that's better."
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,"Thanks, punk."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,"This is good, very good, VERY GOOD, VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO..."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Money Shredder,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...huh.
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, see, I can see the value of other dog races."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Like Pomeranians. Those are NICE, but they aren't Corgis."
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, yeah, I can understand that."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, remember that cute girl from yesterday I mentioned earlier?"
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah...
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The white knight that was with her? She wasn't half-bad either.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, it was obvious that a tapestry of muscles was hidden under her armor."
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I prefer more delicate-looking girls, though."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You can appreciate how something looks, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily YOUR thing."
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"And you, bartender?"
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Me... what?
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Which dog race do you prefer?
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's not the question I was expecting.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...not much of a dog person, actually."
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Do you have any pets?
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A cat named Fore, yeah."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He's just a stray I rescued.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Do you like rescuing girls too?
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm sure I should be making a witty retort right now, but I'm just gonna go ahead and say... no."
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Weird. I've always thought that the ""rescue fantasy"" was universal."
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Why call it Fore?
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fore is a Lilim I met some time ago that...
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...nevermind.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Pretty lame name, if you ask me."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Better than calling it ""Asshat""."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I bet when you and Fore play, it's quite the sight, eh?"
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He's so lively, sometimes I fear Fore shadows my presence entirely."
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You guys want to lose consciousness that much?
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"You really need to calm down with the whole ""pun hating"" stuff, Betty."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"But to move away from this whole Fore ground, what is this ""rescue fantasy"" you mentioned before?"
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You know, the one where wayward, dangerous souls redeem themselves through the power of love."
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The bad boy who turns away a life of crime.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The drug-addict girl who lived on the streets and turned tricks until she found a good man worth changing for.
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's Corny Romance Cliches 101.
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, you're the one with the shelf full of old-lady romance novels. I'll trust you on this."
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey! Fabio the 13th is a national treasure!
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You don't even like guys. Why do you read all those novels?
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They let you put yourself in the place of the main character quite easily.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Even if said main character is a muscular man?
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I see no problem.
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Just... what is your self-image?
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If I can ask something else...
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,What is it?
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do you hate puns so much?
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Many people cringe at puns, you know?"
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but you react like you have a vendetta against them."
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...they made me feel stupid.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... what?
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"When I was a kid, everyone in my house had a penchant for making puns at the drop of a hat."
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was the only one who couldn't get them.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Years later, I finally got them and... THEY WEREN'T THAT FUNNY!"
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They made me feel stupid!
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,All in the name of some terrible joke that wasn't even funny in the first place!
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I've said this so many times I might as well just make a recording, but... you need to chill out, Betty."
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I am chilling out.
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Just because I complain about stuff doesn't mean I'm not relaxed.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm... not sure that's how it works.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Trust me. When I'm tense and angry, you'll know it."
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I fear the thought.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Anyway, I'll go check on the dogs. I'm supposed to be their doctor and they are being suspiciously quiet."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Be careful.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You want anything else?
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'll have a Bloom Light. Actually, make that two, please."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thanks.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Not what I ordered, but whatever..."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Say... you two seem to get along quite well.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, when you are the only sentient humanoids in the entire company, it kinda happens."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sentient?
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"We have a couple of test mannequins and cardboard cutouts, so..."
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Seems there's more to it than just that, though."
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, even if you two are the only ones of your kind, you can still hate each other."
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I guess I'm one of the few that can stand Betty."
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"She's a really nice person, but she doesn't sugar coat things."
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I can see that."
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You should see her treating those dogs.
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"She becomes so patient and understanding, even if it's only for a little while."
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"The dogs don't call her ""Mom"" to mock her."
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can dogs mock people?
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I... don't know.
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"""Even if it's only for a little while""."
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You were eavesdropping?
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So you can say nice things once in a while...
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You say it like I'm the aggressive one here.
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's nice hearing people say good things about you once in a while, you know?"
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You should take your own advice.
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Maybe some other time. I'm not a hugbox.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Anything happened?
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,A dog in the bathroom got angry at his reflection on the mirror and charged into it.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Luckily, nothing bad happened. It just made a dog very confused."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How the hell do they get on top of the sinks?
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They are surprisingly agile even with those stubby little legs.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, yeah. I ordered you this."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Ah, thanks."
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"By the way, Betty, how's Veronica?"
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She... we broke up last month.
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,What?!
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, things were not going so well. We got too used to one another."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Everything was starting to become... routine.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,We decided to break up before things got bitter.
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,And why didn't you tell me that before?
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why? Did you want your turn at the Betty mobile?
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I don't know. I guess I just didn't want to trouble you.
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And, after a while, it stopped feeling like it was something relevant to say."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,*sigh* Please don't do that again. Try trusting me.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, you're right..."
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know what bothers me?
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The fact that asking after someone's health always feels like you're walking on a floor full of glass shards.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's always this chance that the other person is not okay, or even dead..."
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what started as a legitimately fun moment can go sour.
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, you're right."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sorry for not trusting you, you piece o' scrap."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Don't worry. I understand why you did it.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hey. Now that I think about it, you sure hang out with us a lot, bartender."
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, dogs can only be so interesting, and besides, there haven't been as many dogs today."
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is my presence unwanted?
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Not at all. Especially since you're the one bringing the booze.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You're like those cab drivers that like to chat all the way... but you smell better than most of them.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank you.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Funny thing is that we are unofficially associated with a local taxi line.
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They're the ones that send drunkards to their homes.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You seem to really, really like talking to your clients. Like, it's the best part of your job or something."
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It kinda is.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I used to sit around in crowded places like malls or bars and think to myself...
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Each and every person here has a story."""
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a humbling experience.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Everyone has dreams, fears, and loved ones."
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you dig deep enough, you'll realize that the gap between two random people isn't as big as you think it is."
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In fact, it's quite small."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And in this job, you get to hear all kinds of stories."
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some people just blurt it all out. Some do it while drunk.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"To know that no matter how similar they might seem at first glance, no two people are alike... it's fascinating."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You could be a powerful information broker with all that knowledge.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nah. Not interested.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I like to see myself more as a friendly ear rather than someone you need to be wary of.
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I guess there're still decent folks out there.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm not decent?
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,YOU'RE CRITICALLY OBSESSED WITH DOGS!
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll go check if there's any other dogs who want something.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sure.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Go ahead.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gruff Bucket,QUICK! A BEER!
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay...
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gruff Bucket,"Thanks, now... BOOM!"
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...why did you break the glass?
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gruff Bucket,I made breakfast!
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gruff Bucket,Get it? Because you made the drink fast... and I broke it... and...
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...go.
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gruff Bucket,Tough crowd.
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Suddenly, I understand the hate for puns.)"
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey Bat Render!
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah?
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Heheh... your job has a funny name.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't say...
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How is she already drunk? She drank way less than she did last night.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah... but she drank a bottle before coming here.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I wish I knew. It's an example of her alcohol tolerance though.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Bra Denter, I want to make a toast to my good friend the robot here."
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Probably the only person... robot... THING that can stand my yapping for more than half an hour.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Without him, my job would be five times more boring and my life two times more meaningless."
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Cheers!
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not holding a drink.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Then give me one, Ben Trader! Isn't that YOUR job? I need a Beer! A big one!"
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright...
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Alright, cheers!"
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I said... CHEEEEEEERS!
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cheers.
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Cheers.
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Good!
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Grumpy when sober and a sweetheart when drunk. It seems like she's been like this since her university years.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You make it sound like those were a decade ago.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"*AHEM* I can understand liking the taste of alcohol, but what's so good about getting drunk?"
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"First of all, I'm not drunk."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You're too happy.
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm a happy person!
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,When drunk.
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hmph...
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Anyway, it's something you just can't explain."
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You just like it. Your body needs it. Craves it.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's called being an alcoholic.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I prefer the term ""alcohol enthusiast."""
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Anyway, humans actively look for things that make them feel light-headed."
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why else would they leave some poison in potentially poisonous foods like that weird balloon fish thing?
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why would they eat spicy food or drink fermented milk?
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Seriously, how crazy does someone need to be to say ""Hey, let's eat this and see what happens""?"
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Worse yet, they've even found MEDICINE among all that junk."
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The one that invented penicillin was probably the worst of them all.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Fair enough. But see, that's proof you're drunk."
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"If you were sober, you would just say ""Hell if I know..."""
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Silly robot...
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Now that I think about it, what KIND of robot are you?"
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Lilim.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Lilim always sounds too feminine.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Okay then. What manner of piece of scrap are you?
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You don't know?
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Never cared. But now I'm curious.
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Oh. Well. You won't remember it tomorrow.
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'm a DT-01d, a social development robot."
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Is that like the DFC-72s?
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, no... DFC-72s are designed to be as physically human as possible in order to blend in with humans better."
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"My line is more tailored for resilience. We are ""Work Lilim."""
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why must you be cursed to only one destiny from the moment you are born?
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You can do whatever you want, silly robot. Follow your dreams!"
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I know. I'm already doing it.
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Being created or hardwired for one duty only means you're more adept at certain things.
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Giving robots freedom of choice? That's the whole purpose of the ADN law.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, but you know... you say you're resilient, but you don't look the part."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"True, I never upgraded my muscles, but I can stand up to 200 degrees Celsius without breaking a sweat."
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lilim can sweat?
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Cooling agents, yes."
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,No matter! You're still special to me no matter what kind of robot you are!
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Lilim.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,No matter what piece of shit you are!
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Speaking of special, how come it isn't legal to marry a dog yet?"
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"'scuse me, what?"
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,If humans are allowed to marry robots... LILIM! I meant Lilim!
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,*ahem* They should be able to marry dogs too.
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Ab Trender~
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's me... I think.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,This guy here wants to bang a dog. Mock him.
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me?
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I do NOT.
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I was just saying that if humans are now allowed to marry Lilim, why shouldn't they be able to marry animals?"
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Because first of all, they're not humanoids."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,What about monkeys then?
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And now you wanna bang a monkey?
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I DO NOT!
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And second of all, dogs, just like many other animals, can't give you consent."
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,But look at these dogs!
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Sure, they have the cognitive abilities of 7-year olds, but they can talk, drink booze, and argue."
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So now you wanna bang a 7-year old?
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We have a regular here who would be delighted to hear that.
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Stop it!
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Remember. Lilim-human marriages were only sanctioned after the Lilim achieved full sentience.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And even then, they used marriage as a way to evolve the Collective Source."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Besides, dogs don't really ""love"" us that way."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Trying to apply human ideas like marriage to a dog is like...
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...like trying to feed vegetables to a carnivore, you get me?"
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Says the ex-vegetarian. Why are you only so smart when drunk?
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm not drunk!
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But, anyways. If you want to screw a dog or a chimp, go ahead."
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Just don't bring marriage or infants into the whole deal... Deal.
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But if you even start thinking about doing the horizontal mambo with a 7-year-old, please seek some mental help."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,But I don't want to bang dogs! Or monkeys! Or 7 year-olds!
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, thank god!"
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Then why did you suddenly start talking about dog-human marriage?
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It's just... I was thinking about all these dogs in tuxedos and...
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...and I started picturing a dog in a bridal dress...
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I mean, Just try and picture that."
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...and I'M the drunk one.
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Wait... I'm not drunk, why would I say that?"
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Then again, when YOU get drunk you only get dizzy."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Do you have a limit? As in, a limit to how much you can drink before passing out?"
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, I just get disoriented to the point I'm effectively useless, but I never pass out."
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Maybe, if I passed out, I wouldn't have to deal with all the shit that follows."
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I always have to wait at least 24 hours before the effects pass.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,One has to wonder why they gave all those human flaws to Lilim.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I read something about that.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It said that by giving Lilim the same kind of weaknesses humans have, they would develop the same way humans do."
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So that's why they also bite their lips randomly when eating?
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems like it.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But it makes me wonder: exactly how anatomically correct are you?
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's something I know and you don't.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hmph...
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any of you want anything else to drink?
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yeah! I want...
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Nothing, you're drunk enough as is."
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're not my dad! You can't tell me what I can or can't do!
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Beatrice Albert, stop drinking right now."
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...yes, mom."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Now, go sleep in the car. We are almost done here."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But mo-om!
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Go.
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hmph...
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Bye, Bad Nerter."
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bye Ms. Betty.
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It... actually worked.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"If I didn't know she wouldn't remember anything tomorrow, I'd be afraid of retaliation."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Although, I'm curious. Why do you call her ""Ms. Betty?"" It makes her sound like a teacher or something."
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Etiquette? I don't know.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's also something about her that makes it feel right to call her that. Maybe, it's the forehead..."
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I see...
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I gotta get things ready. If you'll excuse me..."
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good luck.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyvern Lover,Hey!
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We're closing.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyvern Lover,Dammit!
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, everyone's safe in a cab."
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"We are taking our leave, bartender. Thank you for providing such great service on such short notice."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's my job. Um, you were interesting too?"
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, thank you."
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'll make sure to tell all our associates about the wonders of this place.
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank you, and please come again."
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,We sure will.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Send my regards to Ms. Betty.
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Gladly. See you later then.
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bye.
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,All done?
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup.
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems like we got some new regulars.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yeah... it'd be nice if they came back... or that we're still here when they want to come back.
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You've been acting weird all weekend, Boss. Are you okay?"
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I am, but the bar is not."
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you mean?
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, I guess you have the right to know."
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The BTC sent me a message on Friday. Valhalla hasn't been bringing in much income these last few months.
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Which means that we are at risk of being wiped off the map.
