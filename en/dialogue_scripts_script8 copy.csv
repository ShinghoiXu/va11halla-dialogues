2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah, hello Jill."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,And that cage?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... um... brought my cat.
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Your cat?
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,DID I HEAR YASUNORI KATO WAS IN THE BAR?!
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,BRING ME THAT BASTARD. I'LL GIVE HIM THE FIST OF JUSTICE! I'LL MAKE HIM EAT THE KANTO EARTHQUAKE! I'LL BORROW HIS CAP!
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Wait... there are no evil Onmyouji here.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss... what the fuck?
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Didn't you say you brought Kato to the bar?
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My cat. CAT!
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, that's even better! Hey Fore!"
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,...
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,So cute.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Why did you bring him?
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I heard some apartments in my building were being raided.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't have anything suspicious, but you never know. So I'd rather have him here, at least today."
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah well, I'd say something about the health regulations, but we already had a pack of Corgis here."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Do you want me to take care of him in my office? Please?
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure... but he's a bit shy, so..."
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Alright Fore, let's go to my office."
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I think she didn't hear me.
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say Gil, how do you always come so early?"
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I live close by.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yup, Chief got me a small apartment nearby. Something about the BTC housing program."
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, I got mine through that too..."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, let's start."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Yo! Whazzap!
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Um... lady, did you hear me?"
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A dog. ANOTHER dog.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Hey! I'm not just another dog, I came here as a part-timer!"
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you're the part-timer.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Yeah!
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss! I'm taking my break!
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It's too early!
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shit.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* The part-timer is here!
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Huh, he came early."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why a dog? Why? Why? Why? Why?
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Because look at him! He has a Hawaiian shirt! And sunglasses!
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"And he's a Shiba, not a Corgi. I don't know what you're complaining about."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(They all look the same to me.)
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Granted, Shibas could be seen as the Japanese counterpart to Corgis."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,They're both funny-looking and dogs used by the royalty.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyways. Starting today, this dog will help around here."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,My name is...
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...Boss, please don't shout."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Sorry.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Just call him Rad Shiba.
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why Rad Shiba?
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What part of Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses don't you get? He's the raddest thing here!
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Thanks!
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyways, he will mostly help getting orders, bringing clients in and cleaning, but he ought to know how things work."
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Cleaning? That'd be a change of pace.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He'll act like a client and see how you work.
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... right.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I'll have a Grizzly Temple.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Are you okay?
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, just a couple of post-traumatic flashbacks."
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Wow! This is awful!
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,People actually pay for this shit?
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hard to believe, I know."
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Man, alcohol sucks."
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And yet you looked up a job at a bar.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Alcohol isn't so bad after all!
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Maybe because that didn't have any.)
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... what brings a dog like you to taking a part-time job here?
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I'm here to help the funding of my organization.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you with the Seifar Toy Company?
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,What? No! Don't lump me with those Herding Supremacists.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I have a more noble and benign organization. I belong to CIRA.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,CIRA?
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Canine Independent Rescue Association.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,We give a place where dogs can be dogs and save them from themselves.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"CIRA is what I love, but, damn is it expensive sometimes."
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,We decided to take part-time jobs to help fund anything it needs.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,We want to help CIRA be the best it can be.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you do at CIRA?
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Pay treatment for hurt dogs, give food to the hungry ones, play with the bored ones..."
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,We're there for everyone.
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh... that actually sounds nice.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Say, do you have a menu?"
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Something like that, yeah. Here."
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Now, let's see..."
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Any recommendations?
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Avoid the part with ""Promo"" drinks."
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Oh, the Grizzly Temple is one of those."
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Fluffy Dream? I like the sound of this one.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fluffy Dream.
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Well, this one's nice."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hey! This doesn't look like the glass in the menu.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... dogs see things differently.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Yeah, that must be it."
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, why did you pick a bar?"
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,It seemed fun.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I didn't need that many weird skills to be part of this so it was my best bet.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Besides, it's close to home, so I can get here by walking."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,And I do love me some walks. I could walk all day!
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Weird skills?
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Yeah, stuff like ""food handler's certificate"", ""previous work experience"", or ""thumbs""."
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Why did you pick a bar?
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Um... On a whim too, I guess."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wanted a place where I could see people come and go all the time.
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And bartending sounded a bit more glamorous than just being a store clerk.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Oh yeah. About the way you mix stuff.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah?
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Is it-... hey...
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,It's a cat! A cat!
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Fore, weren't you in Boss' office?"
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hello cat! Wanna play? Let's play!
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,...
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Didn't dogs hate cats or something?
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,We don't hate them - unless they're intruders.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,You said his name was Fore? Hello Fore! Let's play!
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,...
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No playing allowed, you'll make a mess. Fore, go back to Boss' office."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,Meow.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,That's one obedient cat.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My pride.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You want something else?
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Yeah, but I'll talk with John-face here for a bit."
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Eh?
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* (I shouldn't get riled up so easily by dogs, but... I'm just tired, I guess.)"
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hello Jill!
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?! T-That voice...
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Se-... eh?
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,W-What happened to you?!
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Nice seeing you too!
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, I fell from a really tall place to a really rough spot."
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay? Do you need an ambulance or something?
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I just got out of one, don't worry."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did you manage to slip by the mobs lynching White Knights?
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It was a bit rough. Luckily these bandages helped me conceal my identity! Heheh...
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why come straight here?
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I...
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,The ambulance where I got treatment couldn't stray too far away from the hospital.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"They're nice people, I've talked to them a lot while on rescue duties."
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I was nearby and yours was the closest friendly face I could find.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I needed to regain my composure before doing anything else, so... here I am."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Um... if you're scared because they might come for me I can leave, you know?"
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The security systems of the bar are top-notch, and my boss is also the bouncer of sorts here."
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'd say you're actually safer here. So I'm not worried about me.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Instead I'm... worried about you.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"First I hear you were at the bank, then I find out you ""disappeared""."
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And now you show up with all those bandages.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you fine? What happened at that bank exactly?
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you talk with Stella? She was worried sick about you!
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Slow... Slow down a bit... The medications make me feel everything more intensely, almost like a hangover."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Sorry.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It's nice to know someone like a bartender was worried about me though. Thanks.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Everyone I know has been ignoring me, so I was feeling lonely."
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why would they?
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, you've seen the lynches they give to any White Knight they find."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"By ignoring me, they're actually saving me from getting kicked to death."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My good deeds finally paid off, I guess... heheh..."
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything?
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um... something sweet without alcohol.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thank god these pants still had my wallet in them.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh no, I couldn't take your money right now. It's on the-..."
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Jill, please. I wanna pay for my drinks."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I take it I won't be able to change your mind.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Nope. I mean yes. I mean... You won't be able to change my mind.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...sweet and no alcohol, right? Coming right up."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Careful.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yay! This'll help me calm down a bit.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It burns a bit...
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what happened to you? Where did you fall from?"
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I was escaping the place near the end of the whole thing, and I had to make a leap of faith."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I've jumped from higher places, but I landed badly here."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Most of my injuries are actually from some debris that fell on me.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh, but my broken arm is actually from the fall."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How?
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I rolled to mitigate the fall, but I made a bad move and broke it."
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Good thing I drink lots of milk!
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I was under rubble for quite a bit, but luckily someone found me."
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Someone""?"
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I woke up in the hospital, they told me some guy brought me there."
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I don't know who he was, but I owe him my life."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,W-What?
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"N-Nothing, you just sound um... cheerful."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm alive! Why wouldn't I be?
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"After all that happened at the bank, here I am, talking to you. Being able to talk at all."
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Don't think too much about it. I'm fine! I'm totallyfi-owowowowowow...
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Eh... um...
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,H-How were things around here? I heard there was a huge commotion when the whole thing happened.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I had to sleep here in the bar on Saturday, but I guess it could've been worse."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Glad to know that.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you contact Stella? She was on the verge of despair yesterday.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Eh... um...
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,H-Hey Jill! I want another drink! A... uh... um... a Bleeding Jane!
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...here.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,C-Cheers! Nf...
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Phew...
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thanks!
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah...
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Eh... um...
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-I'll save it for later.
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... how were things inside the bank?
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,*cough* *cough* Come again?
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What happened inside the bank? How did you manage to get through it?
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um... I was with this nice bunch of people. Well... they were apparently nice at the very least.
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"We tried our best to find a way out of the whole thing, cracking through the security, finding safe spots."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But then...
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um...
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry for asking all that, it was obviously over the line."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"N-No, don't worry about it. It's just the analgesics still numbing me."
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'll take my leave now. Thank you for everything, Jill."
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you alright?
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'm fine, I'm fine."
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That girl saw some awful things inside that bank.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,The sight of desperate people stuck in one building is enough to scar anyone.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe I shouldn't have said all that?
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, if it's true that she just woke up and ended up here..."
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, I feel like I was being too pushy."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That's not something I can measure.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You were just worried. I bet she's just still in shock.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... Gil...
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Want me to make sure she's fine on her way?
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please.
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright.
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll go and take my break now.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um...
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh? Weren't you leaving?
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, I was but... well..."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You know how I just said I was fine?
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah?
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-I'm not.
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,So I wanted to know if you could lend me your ear for a bit.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I was gonna take my break..."
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Oh sorry...
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, What I mean is that I could lend you an ear if you don't mind going to the back alley for a bit."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Y-Yeah, please..."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want one?
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Sorry, I haven't smoked since high school."
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But don't mind me though. Smoke ahead.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... why me?
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You're the closest friend I have nearby that isn't avoiding me and.. and I think I'm about to explode.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,B-B-Because I'm afraid! I'm terrified! I'm scared!
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My colonel was using me when I made that errand, he saw me as a disposable pawn!"
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Then the whole thing got closed at the bank.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,We were stuck there with no food or water for three days!
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-I saw a man be beaten to death after he found some snack in his pocket... that... that...
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I... I...
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"When I was in rescue duties I usually dealt with collapsing buildings, fire, that kind of stuff."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,B-But seeing people do that to other people is just...
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I... *sniff* I...
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Calm down, nobody will hurt you here."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You sure?
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll make sure of it, just... take deep breaths."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I can't even imagine what happened there. And truth be told, I don't want to imagine it."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But it's easy to tell you bottled up everything while you were there.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Is it obvious?
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Kinda.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, I had to get outta there. Fear would've only gotten in the way."
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"And besides, I made a promise to come back to..."
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Err...
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, what's the deal with Stella?"
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Nothing, I'm just..."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Afraid?
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,The word loses meaning after using it so much in so little time.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"She should've been worried sick, and I couldn't call her after I came back. I'm afraid of what she will say."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She will insult you, she looks like that kind of girl."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I'm betting all I have that she will be quickly happy that you're fine and alive.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah... you're right.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Think about it this way: A slap or despair for what's left of her life.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I wouldn't pretend to disappear, I mean..."
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Besides, from what you tell me you're pretty much only coming to your senses today, right?"
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It's weird how everything can change in such a short notice, you know?"
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,On Thursday I was a girl doing her duties minding only her own business.
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Now I'm injured and woke up to find out I can't go back to those duties.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Part of me is happy, I knew full well White Knights usually did more harm than good."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"On the other hand, I really loved my job. Now I'm stuck with nothing to do."
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I know how that is. The life changing on such short notice part, I mean."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Really?
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I would tell you why I know that, but I think you should go see Stella right now."
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, you're right."
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Speaking of which... Hey Gil!
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What?
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do me a favor and escort Sei to... wherever she needs to go, please."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Only if you cover my share of the work.
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Okay then. Let's go Miss.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,R-Right!
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Thank you for hearing me out, Jill!"
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anytime.
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*whew* Hope everything goes alright.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, hey Jamie."
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... Jamie...
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Ah Jill. Gillian isn't here I see.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you alright? You look distracted.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'm fine, don't worry."
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If you say so.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Jiiiiiiiill! Where do I take Fore if he needs to use the bathroom?
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The cage has a small litter box included!
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oooooh, that's convenient!"
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Fore?
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fore's my cat. Some apartments in my building are being inspected today...
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I brought him to work in case they enter my place while I'm gone.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Ah, I see."
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The usual Gut Punch.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I thought when someone ordered a Gut Punch, you had to make a joke..."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...about giving the client a punch to the stomach or something.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, that? In theory, yeah. Gil's the only one that pays attention to that though."
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Really?
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He didn't receive proper training, he read an old manual my boss had."
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There WAS some sort of stipulation mentioning the need to say puns.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But seems like it was some sort of anti-counterfeit measure.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, if they copied such a silly stipulation, they'd be caught in the act."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Like when the dictionaries added fake words to spot if someone else just copied all of it?
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Why not tell him that?
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's too amusing, to be honest."
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Yeah, this'll do."
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Seems you're distracted too.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A bit, yeah."
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what's on your mind that's distracting you so much?"
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Nothing you should think about too much.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It's like those times you just feel uneasy for no good reason.
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You might have actual reasons to feel that way though.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Come to think of it, ""mercenary"" is quite the uncommon occupation, wouldn't you say?"
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I like to see what I do as bounty hunting actually.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The only jobs I don't take are those where I have to deal with people who just happened to be in the wrong place.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,There are some people willing to pay to off someone that has done no wrong.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Things like killing someone that owns a house in the way of some building, or a nosy reporter."
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'm not better for turning a blind eye to such requests, but I'm not gonna be the one dealing with those."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The bounty hunter part comes where?
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,If I'm sent to kill someone that has done something like stealing or killing and I get paid for it...
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,You could see it as bounty hunting.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I guess."
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It's just cheap justifications for killing people though. In the end they're cheap.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"However, I won't be one to kill for petty reasons like those."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,But let's change the subject here. I'll have something bitter if you don't mind.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh? Sure.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Ah yes...
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You just reminded me of my grandpa.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He used to eat Bronson roots every afternoon. He said they made him stronger.
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Bronson roots have more nutrients per gram than most vitamin supplements.
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Your grandpa knew what he was doing.
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"This is close, yeah."
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Sure, if I put my mind on it I might feel the Bronson taste but..."
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Sorry.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It seems I always manage to make you uncomfortable, Jill. Sorry."
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, no. Don't worry."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although I guess it's mostly because I can't wrap my mind around the whole ""taking a human life"" thing."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Knowing you've killed people and are now talking to me here? It's... weird.
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It reminds me of when I first took sex ed classes.
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I couldn't wrap my mind around people doing that stuff and living normally.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Unlike with sex ed, it's better that you stay that way, mind you."
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Taking lives is not something you should get used to.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Ah yes, I know a good way to change the subject a bit."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Would you like to hear about the most dangerous bounty hunter in the city?
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The way you said that was like offering a tale to a bored kid. But yeah, I'd like to hear that one."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"You see, there was actually a bounty hunter organization in this city not too long ago."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Law enforcement would put a price on a dangerous person's head and pay for the proof of that person's death.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,There was a guy everyone called Jet Black James. He got the nickname because he always wore black clothes.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The interesting thing was that the black clothes were there to hide blood stains he got from his contracts.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"His tracking skills were top-notch, his information network was the best."
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Some even joked he would finish the bounty within half an hour, or he wouldn't take the reward."
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"...he was too good, in fact."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,At one point he took all bounties and didn't take a single reward. He was just that crazy by then.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The last bounty that the organization ever posted was on James' head.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"The police had him cornered. His last words were ""Send it all to my account"" before shooting himself."
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Damn... why hasn't that been made into a movie?
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... there were no more bounties after that?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,A registered bounty hunter was charged with many counts of manslaughter using his old targets as proof.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"If somebody else tried to recreate the organization, the seed of doubt would grow in little to no time."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,What guarantee is there that such an organization wouldn't actually be a trap?
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They could use the registered bounty hunters to take care of the most bothersome criminals...
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,And then dispose of the bounty hunters by pressing charges using their targets as evidence.
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,So... no. Jet Black James made sure that no law enforcement organization is able to set up bounty hunting of any kind.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Ever since then, anyone crazy enough to be a bounty hunter works independently."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Were you part of that organization?
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I've actually had those suspicions I'm telling you about since the day I heard such a thing exists.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Glad to know I wasn't just paranoid.
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know how well you changed the subject, but that was certainly one interesting story."
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Just to make sure. You're not a rebuilt Jet Black James or something, right?"
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"The name James is pretty common, Jill."
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Besides, if I remember correctly, his real name was actually Theodore."
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"That story left my throat a bit dry. Get me a Beer, please."
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,One of mankind's oldest friends. Cheers.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It... tastes watered down.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...here.
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Jill, get your mind out of that story and focus, please."
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"One obvious thing I see is that you don't take the use of the word ""kill"" in your stride the way Gillian does."
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm not good with violence.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,That's good.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It's interesting though. When I compare you two, it's obvious Gillian has seen quite the share of traumatic stuff."
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That guy's a handful because of that sometimes.
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, he's one of the most reliable people I've ever met."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Where is he, by the way?"
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I asked him to keep an eye on a girl that came here earlier.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I feel that if something happened, he could resolve the situation."
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,His nose must be itching after we talked so much about him.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Yeah, maybe."
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Well, I've got to go."
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Send my regards to your boss and Gillian.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will do.
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Man, today's been quite heavy."
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Everyone-...
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...wait.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(If I say it out loud, I feel like I will just tempt fate.)"
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...but let's try it anyways.)
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Everyone has just been gloomy face after gloomy face... and that dog.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I sure hope the next client changes that.
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So you still work here?
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I KNEW IT! Err... I mean...
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Quite the surprise to see you here again, Mr. Ingram."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Got out of my job, I needed a drink badly, and I remembered this crackhouse was nearby."
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you then?
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I'll have a Bleeding Jane.
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Tastes just like the pasta sauce my mom used to make.
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Watered down, artificial, and nasty."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Here we go again. Don't worry, I'm actually in a not-foul mood for a change."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Riiiiiight.)
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"This works too, I guess."
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Aaaaaaaaand we're up to a good start.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, where do you work, Mr. Ingram?"
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"I don't have a specific job, but there's this... well... ""network"" of engineers in need of assistants."
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"I have no idea what they do there, but I can follow instructions and that's all they need."
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Recently I've been working with this Sylia girl working on some experimental powered suits.
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,My only duty is to give them maintenance once a day.
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What's that about a ""network""?"
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,All those nerds know each other and they recommend me.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I don't ask questions and quickly learn to do whatever they need.
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, sounds nice."
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,It's pretty monotonous at times though.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Why are you giving me that look?
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're just more cheerful than the last time you came.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,We all have good days and bad days. Today just so happens to be a not-bad day.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Besides, with everyone scared shitless in their houses, the streets are clear with no traffic jams."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,That's always a plus.
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess...
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I feel curious though, what's your stance on the whole Apollo Trust Bank thing?"
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,One corrupt organization showed its true colors...
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,And now the other corrupt organizations are saving face condemning them.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,The whole thing feels almost cartoony in how they went full villain after the cat got out of the bag.
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"The whole deal with Alice_Rabbit's intervention at the bank made it feel more like a crazy PR stunt, though."
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, sometimes life is just that weird."
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yeah, like you know anything about life."
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"It almost became a bad day though, thanks to some teens on the way here."
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did they do?
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"It's not what they did, it's what they said."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,They were talking about how they should just go to Zaibatsu Corp's HQ and blow it up.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"I've seen one too many kids throwing around that ""let's kill the king"" attitude when it comes to Zaibatsu Crap."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Even if Zaibatsu Corp's building suddenly went down, the ones behind it would be still alive."
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Killing the head honcho just means his or her duties go to the next rimjobber on the totem.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Hell, I bet they're plotting to kill each other anyways."
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Kids these days see too many action films where the rebels save the day by killing the ""Evil Corporation""."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't let it get to you.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"I don't, I just hate teenagers."
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's interesting though. A big corporation in control is somehow more dangerous than a regular government.
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I wouldn't know. I'm not a political person.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(No shit.)
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Alright. Give me a Zen Star, and try not to mess it up."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yes, it's just as nasty as I've heard."
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why order it then?
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Not your problem.
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"This is nasty, but not the nasty I was looking for."
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,...I'll let you off the hook this time.
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,And you managed to mess it up! Bravo!
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"So, where's the Red Comet?"
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My boss? She...
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Jill, Fore's headed your way!"
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Let's play, Fore! Let's play!"
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,...
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Oh! A customer. Sorry for the intrusion.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,You have a dog here? And a cat?
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The cat's mine, his name's Fore. The dog just... hangs around here."
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Heh, I remember my daughter wanted a cat."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I told her she couldn't have one but she went and fed some stray that passed by the house.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Mozart, she called him."
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Even after all these years, that cat still passes by the house from time to time."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Hunts a couple of birds, sleeps in a tree on the yard and leaves."
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,My wife is devils-know-where and my daughter is playing with her grandparents.
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,How pathetic can I be when the only creature that hasn't left me is some fucking stray cat?!
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,...
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,Meow.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,What? Are you a stray too?
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He is.
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Figures.
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Alright, I'm gonna take my leave here."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I don't like eating or drinking surrounded by animals and that cat.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,As if.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You still came back though.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,He looked cool.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up and leave.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,He looks well groomed and his fur looks healthy.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Seems you take good care of him.
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You seem to know a lot about cats.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"No, that's just common sense."
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you like cats, Mr. Ingram?"
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I don't dislike them.
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,But I do dislike having animals near me when I'm eating or drinking.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So... I'll take my leave.
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Don't count on it.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You said that last time.
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Congratulations, you scared a client off."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Fore's as guilty as me.
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but I like Fore. He's my baby."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Now go. Play or something.
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Right!
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, you're back. What happened with Sei?"
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That Cat Boomer girl picked her up.
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I couldn't see anything, but I guess she was happy."
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Glad to hear that.
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Did I miss something?
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Only Jamie and... some other guy came.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I see.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You look exhausted.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yesterday was filled with people carrying heavy emotional baggage.
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't mind it, but dealing with them tired me out a little bit."
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I actually found myself wanting Dorothy to burst out of that door at any moment.
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So you missed Dorothy?
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Kinda.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But anyway! Nothing a good night of sleep can't fix.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's just wrap things up around here and call it a day.
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Too much heavy stuff lately.)
