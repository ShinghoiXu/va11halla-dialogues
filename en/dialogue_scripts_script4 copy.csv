2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening...
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hello.
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...!
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Seems you made it just in time.
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think that's just a car backfiring.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Really? It sounded more like a gunshot to me.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you ever heard gunshots?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Haven't we all at some point?
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, well..."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,See? Sounds more like a car's exhaust.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I don't know... It's too dry.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but gunshots give more echo."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What if it's a firecracker?
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, boss."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Firecrackers?
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yup. A couple of years ago there was an incident where some dude killed a cop.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He managed to slip away because his pistol was mixed up with the usual Mega Christmas firecrackers.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Nah, it sounded too hollow for firecrackers."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, whatever. This is not a morning talk show."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm not paying you to chit-chat about meaningless things.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...at least not amongst yourselves.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Right, we shouldn't lose time over a CAR'S EXHAUST."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hey!
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Hello, I'm looking for some information..."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of information?
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"What can you tell me about a girl nicknamed ""Crimson Rose""?"
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds like a tacky online handle.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although ""tacky online handle"" is a bit redundant."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Do you know anything about her?
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nope, sorry."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I have $80 here that might refresh your memory.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now that you mention it, I remember something..."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Really?!
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. Now I'm totally sure that I have no idea whatsoever who you're talking about.
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Nothing at all?
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nothing.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Man, you're a sucky bartender. Not having any info I need."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* Well. First of all, why assume I just happen to have the info you conveniently need?"
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Does that girl frequent this place? Is there any proof that I might have the info you so desperately need?
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, I..."
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And second, you're not going to get anywhere by offering me physical money."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In fact, what are you doing with physical money? Do you wanna get mugged so badly?"
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, well..."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"MOREOVER, even if I did know something, do you really think $80 is enough?"
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can do almost NOTHING with $80. It's not enough to have a decent lunch.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Why are you scolding me?
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why did you call me a sucky bartender for not conveniently having the info you need?
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I...
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Wait... of course! You want all deals to be clean, so you need me to spend money on the bar."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"That's how it works, right? I spend money. You give me the info."
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...maybe, maybe not."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Okay then, get me a drink, but keep it under $80."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Now THIS makes you a sucky bartender.
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I can change it if you want.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Nonononononono, don't."
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"In fact, I'll just forget the info thing."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Okay then. Do you know anything about the girl?
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,But you said...
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Maybe, maybe not"". Turns out that it's maybe not."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You were the one deluding yourself into thinking I might know something.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And like I said: $80 is nothing.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,So -- I need to spend more?
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll give you some intel.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Spend all the money you want, but I know nothing and no amount will change that."
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Can I at least get my money back?
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Why? The order is right, isn't it?"
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,*sigh* I guess.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, why are you looking for that girl, mister...?"
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Von Delay, Art Von Delay."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'm a private detective. It's what I do.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, I'll assume you're either looking for a missing girl or working for a creepy online stalker."
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"You're assuming the girl I'm looking for is innocent, or lost."
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's not?
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She's half of the so-called ""Reapers"" of the city."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Two guns-for-hire that work for whoever's resourceful enough to find them and wealthy enough to pay them.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Crimson Rose and Cobalt Lily, they call themselves."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(They still sound more like teenagers' internet nicknames.)
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, who wanted you to track her?"
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I don't know. I got the letter with the instructions and a paycheck.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What if it's a prank?
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I have the money, so what do I care if it is?"
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Besides, considering the amount I was able to cash in with that check, it'd be a pretty wasteful prank."
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Still, any information or rumors you could give me?"
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,They don't have to be related to the girl.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do you need them?
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,It's always good to keep up with local goings-ons.
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well... let's see...
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry. Can't think about anything right now. Most of the conversations you hear in here aren't rumor-worthy.
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Humor-worthy, maybe. But not much about current events. At least, not beyond what you see on the news."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Dammit! What kind of bar is this if you can't gather the word on the street?
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(What kind of film noir world do you think you live in?)
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil might know something if you're so fixated on finding some kind of information.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I-I don't know what you're talking about.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Do you know something that might help me, Gil?"
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I don't. I certainly don't and I'm offended by the suggestion that I do.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,He knows something.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"On second thought, maybe it's better if you don't get involved with him."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, this has been a major waste of time."
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And here I thought all the noise BTC bars have made lately would be useful for something.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Noise? What noise?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You don't know?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm asking for a reason.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You'll find out soon enough. Don't worry.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"In any case, I guess I'll have another drink and leave."
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'll have a Grizzly Temple.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Simple enough.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Okay then. This is going to be deducted from the $80 from earlier, right?"
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Fine...
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Wrong! Not paying for this!
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Try not to look so happy at least.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Come on! There has to be something.
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,This week has been slow as hell.
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,The only good thing I've heard is about this girl who threw herself off the roof of a nearby mall.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And the whole thing about a woman catching her mid-air makes me think it's totally made up.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Aside from rumors that ""The Harbingers"" are looking to cause trouble at a bank today... no, not really."
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Dammit!
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Wait... who told you that?
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It appeared on the news, didn't it?"
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, but the name ""The Harbingers"" wasn't used."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,No Glitch City outlet has reported that themselves.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,There are rumors that someone or something is keeping them silent.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"And even the international outlets aren't using the name ""Harbingers""."
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"They're avoiding acknowledging the organization yet, for some reason."
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,So you're either one of them or somebody in the know told you about it.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Wow, he can be surprisingly sharp.)"
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah. Donovan D. Dawson was in here for the last three days, actually."
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Really?!
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder if he'll notice the glass that idol signed...)
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I mean, sure. I can't think of anything that would be useful involving him right now, but..."
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Guess not...)
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Did he talk about anything interesting?
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Interviewing the Idol that had a show a couple of days ago, dealing with messy interns..."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Par for the course, I guess."
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I see, I see... that's..."
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Gunshot!
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a backfire.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,FIRECRACKERS!
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, what do you think that sound just now was?"
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Sounded like something very heavy being dropped.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Something heavy? Come on! That's not even close!
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It was definitely more like an explosion of some kind.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"No, you could clearly hear the clashing of metal."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Something that was both made out of metal and very heavy fell down. That's what made the sound.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Whatever it is, it's not normal for it to be repeating so often."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder if something's happening.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I heard there were some gang spats going on. Maybe they took the conflict here.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Which means... gunshots!
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If that's the case, I just hope they don't come too near us."
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, I've got to go. Seems coming here wasn't a waste of time after all."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Really. I just have different needs. But there will come a time when this place might help me.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Goodbye.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Please, come again."
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gangs, then?"
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Unlikely. This is Unicorn territory.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,They've always been a neutral and important third party in other gangs' deals.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The who what now?
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* I'll just pretend I heard nothing.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thank you.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He left me thinking about the whole ""noise from BTC bars"" thing."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's up with that?
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I think I heard something about money laundering through bars.
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Don't take my word for it though.
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess I'll find out... soon enough.
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welco-...

191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"It's Friday night, and you all know what that means! It's time for Streaming-chan's Escapades!"
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Today's Escapade is brought to you by Shining Fingered dot moe.

197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse-...
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Today I picked the shoddiest, nastiest, smelliest, ugliest bar I could find downtown."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And sadly, it actually looks half-decent inside. So much for going to a craphole bar that smells like dog urine."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Heheh...
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me...
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"But no matter. Tonight, I'll give you an Escapade you'll never forget."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hey, you! Where's the bartender?"
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're talking to her.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Very funny. Where is he, really?"
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right in front of you.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hey, you! The pretty boy over there. Where's the bartender?"
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You're looking at 'em.
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,N-No way!
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"No hot, shirtless guy playing with fire and serving drinks while flirting with you?"
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"No sexy, scantily-clad girl jiggling around the place?"
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You're telling me YOU TWO, dressed like fucking waiters, are the bartenders here?!"
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup.
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Seems that way...
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is that a problem?
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Of course it's a problem. Friday nights are peak viewing hours!
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I need something sexy or enticing to keep them interested.
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh well, there's an easy solution to that."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There is?
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Yeah. Just take your top off.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You might need to take off your bra too, depending on how the traffic goes."
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wait, you're quite flat. Do you even use a bra?"
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Is that piercing glare a ""no""?"
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Come on! One of us is gonna have to take off their top off and it ain't gonna be me. I already did that once today.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Agh! And it's too late to go somewhere else. By the time I find an even nastier bar, they'll be closed."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What's your policy on wearing pants?
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Somebody tried to have me fired for wearing a skirt, so we deal with that on a case by case basis."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That's not a concrete answer. I need binary yes/no answers. My viewers have the attention span of fruit flies.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"If they wanted to use their brains, do you think they'd watch something like this?"
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I need to keep them entertained, and the fact that you still have your shirt on isn't helping."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wait, I know! Give me a drink! A big one! The nastiest one you can think of!"
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Um... hello? Service here, please."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Wow, it's like my brain shut down.)"
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure...
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Alright then! Cheers!
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't think you should chug it down so...
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...quickly.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"It's like it hit me, but I didn't feel it until a few seconds later."
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Is this what being kicked in the balls feels like?
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yup.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Okay! Cheers!
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you shouldn't drink that so quickly.
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Woohoo! Those were nice.
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wait! They were nice! I wanted nasty drinks, stuff that taste like paint thinner."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,No cookie for you!
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Okay. I've decided. I'll just get really wasted.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"That's gotta be fun enough, right?"
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If you say so...
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Okay! In the meantime, what can you tell me about this bar?"
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you mean?
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Weird stories! Fun stuff! Interesting facts!
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You're being seen by an average of 6,000 people. Make their time worth it!"
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see then...
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Last weekend we held a party for the Seifar Toy Company.
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,And?
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a company run completely by dogs.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Really?
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This place was completely overrun by Corgis.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Wait wait wait... Corgis?!
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Did you really serve drinks to Corgis?!
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Tuxedo-clad talking Corgis, yeah."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Wow! Awesome!
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wait, you're not shitting me, right?"
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...I wish I was shitting you, trust me."
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What else? What else?
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... let's see...
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Donovan D. Dawson from The Augmented Eye was here for three nights in a row.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That perfumed chauvinistic bastard?
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Huh, there's that word again.)"
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Just the other day someone from The Augmented Eye interviewed me, actually."
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did they ask?
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, the usual bullshit. Who I was, what I did, future plans, inspirations..."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"The one that interviewed me was this small, meek girl with glasses."
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,She seemed a bit bitter though. I wonder why.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But enough about tha-... wait. Can I see that glass over there?
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm? Sure.
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,This signature... Is this *Kira* Miki's autograph?!
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, she came here before her last concert."
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Get out! Really?!
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Is this some kind of secret hidden bar of the stars or something?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not really. We're just in the right place at the right time.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What kind of person is she when she's not on stage?
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I've tried to get a meeting with her, and she actually seemed willing but she's always busy."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A very nice girl, actually."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She seems to be completely invested in her work. She loves what she does and it shows.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You'd think she'd be some sort of diva, but as far as I'm concerned, she's one of the nicest people I've met."
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I KNEW IT! I knew she was nice.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Her passion shows in her concerts, you know? She's so... spontaneous. Her performances are never the same."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Every time she sings Shine Spark, I feel like my soul is warming up like a high-performance computer."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,SHIIIIIIIIIINE SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARK!!
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I find myself singing it in the shower all the time.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And those who pay Premium can hear me sing everyday! At $99.99 a month, go Premium now!"
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"That aside, I was about to call bullshit on what you said."
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But I guess you do have some sort of proof for everything.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Can I keep this glass?
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Pretty please?
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Party pooper.
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,At least this bar might be more interesting than I initially thought.
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,The one thing that'd make it perfect is if pretty boy over there had a past with the KGB.
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,WHO TOL-...!
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Y-Yeah... that'd be crazy, huh?"
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you gonna order anything else?
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"What? Oh. Yeah, yeah. The whole getting wasted thing."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I heard of a drink called a Bad Touch.
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Get me a big one of those, please. A Big Bad Touch."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfffft* C-coming right up.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I was expecting something... dirtier.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We have olive brine - I can pour in a bit, if that's what you want."
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"No, not that."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"With such a dirty name, it feels like the drink ought to come in a phallic glass or be this thick white liquid."
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That would've skyrocketed the watchers at least threefold.
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Don't you have anything like that?
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nope.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,*sigh* I'll have to make do with the condensed milk when I get home.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Seems she didn't notice it's not the right drink.)
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Wait! The order is wrong!
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Dammit!)
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, well. Doesn't look like that would've solved anything anyway."
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Friendly reminder that today's Escapade is brought to you by Shining Fingered dot moe!
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Leaders of VR adult entertainment since 2069!
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Buy a year of Premium membership for a neat code.
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Said code will net you a free trial of a VR experience with a model based on moi!
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's the deal with that VR experience?
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, a fan made an NND model of me."
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,When Shining Fingered asked me about a model for our partnership I just contacted him.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"He got money for polishing the model a lot more, I got my partnership. We all won!"
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I even got him a year of free Premium membership and a VR set!
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's nice.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...wait. What's NND?
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Don't tell me you haven't heard of Niku Niku Dance.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I asked for a reason.
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's... well it's music videos with 3D models.
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Yeah, that sounds like a good enough explanation."
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"To be honest though, the model is a bit... meatier than me."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Not that I mind it though, considering the use it gets."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You know, I was expecting you to be more... scared when I said that you're being watched by a lot of people."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's hard to be scared when you can't see these people.
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"But they're still there, you know?"
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Sure, they're behind screens and sometimes in the opposite corner of the world..."
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But every single one of my viewers is a real person with a real life.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Not being here doesn't make them any less real.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I understand, but it's just not the same. They're not here, visibly paying attention to me."
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't get paranoid because of my phone contacts.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"That's true, I guess."
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,So... tell me. What made a lady like you become a bartender?
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not exactly an exciting story.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Does it involve a man?
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What about a crime?
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nope.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,A childhood promise?
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nah.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,A religious vow?
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A what?
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You're not gonna tell me that you just decided out of the blue to quit your job and start bartending.
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's actually what happened... sorta.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, come on! No epiphany? Quarter-life crisis? Not even a hot teacher somewhere along the line?"
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...*cough*
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,L-Life isn't always a young adult novel where every decision is a road cone.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,And that's a problem. One third of my audience are teens that shouldn't be allowed to watch my streams.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Throw me a bone here. There must be a nice, mystical story you can tell about yourself, Ms. Bartender."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Yeeeeeeeeeeeeees?
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some time after I started working I got an interesting client.
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He was a DRK-S0L, a really old Lilim model."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Apparently his power supply was running low.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"His charger was destroyed, and he didn't have the money to buy upgrades or replacements."
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He also seemed to have neglected his maintenance.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He was from the time when the Collective Source wasn't a cloud storage system.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So he wouldn't be uploaded there once his body ran out of energy.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Keep going...
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It was weird, you know? He was the only Lilim I've seen with a clear cut fear of mortality."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No transcendence for him. He would disappear once his batteries ran out.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""It's like knowing you'll vanish while everyone else passes on to heaven"", he said."
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, man..."
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess he felt bad about burdening someone else with his problems.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So he went and gave me a fingertip of his that fell while we were talking.
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Before he left, he said, ""If you remember me, maybe a part of me will transcend."""
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Bravo! Bra-vo!
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Touching! Full of feeling! Completely awesome!
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I'd pay to see a movie like that.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"So, what happened to that finger?"
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I made a pendant out of it. I carry it with me at all times.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Even while bathing?
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,ALMOST all times.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now that I think about it, how do you handle the stream if you want to watch a movie or something?"
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I have a plugin that lays mosaic censorship over whatever I watch on TV or in the theater.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"So... Any kinky stories you can tell us, Ms. Bartender?"
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,: Kinky?
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,A client that paid you with his body.
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Spending half an hour of quality time with pretty boy over there in the closet.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Getting a raise by pleasing your boss...
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,No quickie with the hobos behind the bar? No stumbling upon a furry orgy in the alleys?
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do I get this feeling you're trying to see if anybody has done the same things you have?
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That's something only my Premium members get to know. Only $99.99 a month! Go Premium!
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, no sexual gentlemen-magazine-worthy stories."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Okay, maybe not here, but what about your daily life?"
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's for me to know and you to never hear about.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Fiiiiiiine. What about your clients, then? Some must've told you some incredible stories."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Those are spur of the moment things I don't repeat to others.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"On one hand, I'm feeling so secure with you right now that I could tell my life's story."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"On the other hand, YOU'RE NOT MAKING MY JOB ANY EASIER!"
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Don't you have like... a really stacked friend that's willing to pretend to be a bartender for half an hour?
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That would at least mean some eye candy.
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Look, I don't know. Maybe, you've got nice legs, but they don't mean much if you're behind a counter, lady."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Okay, this is getting stale. I'm gonna heat this up this even if I have to do it myself."
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"We need to drop a cow in here. Ms. Bartender, get me drunk. I don't care how, just... do it."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay...
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So?
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Lightheadedness...
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Clumsy tongue...
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Palms sweaty, knees weak, arms spaghetti..."
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Can't feel my legs...
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Can't feel my legs!!
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Heheh... alright, let's get it on with the lewd stuff!"
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"First, I'll try to guess your bust size."
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I must warn you, I have a 90% success rate with this."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Hm... I'd say...
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,B! Not big enough to fill a hand but not small enough to make you look like a child.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You're a size B, right?"
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm not discussing my bust.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Don't be like that. I can tell you're B-cup.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Your attitude makes me think you're an S, and your behavior makes me think your blood is AB."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,So? How many did I get right?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who knows...
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,AAAAAAGH!!! Please let me get on with this. I need you to cooperate if this is going to be a success.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I ask something?
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Finally!
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's the point of getting drunk if you're going to behave the same way?
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Heheheh... I guess it is kind of redundant...
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Because you see, I'm drunk 24/7."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Knowing people want to watch me do anything and everything...
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Seeing the viewer count steadily raise as I take more risks and become more adventurous...
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's a feeling that neither alcohol nor sex can compare to.
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Speaking of sex, if I get lucky tonight, you only need to pay $99.99 to see what happens afterwards!"
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Go Premium or go home!
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Umm... do you really ""get lucky"" if the other person knows they're being streamed?"
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You'd be surprised by how many are actually turned on by that.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How do you deal with people who don't want their identities revealed?
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Everything's written here.
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""By being captured by this camera, you hereby provide consent to the use of your face..."""
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""...on all material produced by Streaming-chan L.L.C."""
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm not sure how legal that is.
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,People believe it is and I've yet to be troubled by a lawyer.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"It's funny, though. When you're on the street, unless it's somebody really hot, you can't recall their faces..."
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But learn their name and suddenly they're a fucking snowflake that's better than all the rest.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Huh, this is weird. I'm feeling sleepy."
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You did ask me to get you drunk. Why is it weird?
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Because I haven't felt sleepy in quite some time. In fact, I've been sleep deprived for a while now."
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How long?
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,A week.
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A week?!
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Weeks are the ones with 30 days, right?"
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Yup, totally sleepy. I can feel my eyes getting heavier."
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,And there's this weird lag when I try to move. What's up with that?
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Anyways, I think I'll take a little nap here before storming off and continuing the night."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,If you'll excuse me...
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Should I call a cab?
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And risk waking her up? Leave her be. I'd rather break the rules and let her sleep than deal with her again.
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Nope. A bit hot, but not lightheaded. Then again, I'm always hot."
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Hot-headed.)
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Your drinks are either too light or I'm more resilient to alcohol than I thought.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Okay, let's try this from a different angle. You ask the questions."
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of questions?
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I don't know, I'm not the bartender. Do your bartender-ish thing."
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What made you decide to start streaming yourself 24/7?
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"See? That's what I'm talking about. You're the bartender here, bartender."
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Anyway, have you ever done something reckless or stupid because of peer pressure?"
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think that's something everyone has gone through.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, it used to be that I very rarely succumbed to such problems."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I was the type to never take risks or try new things.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Every time I did, I was scolded rather than praised."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What point is there in doing this stuff if nobody acknowledges you did well?
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But some time ago I stumbled upon a friend who would stream herself... talking.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Nothing risque or noteworthy.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"She invited me on, and... well... the comments were intoxicating."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,The internet is a big place. Somehow I found within those comments people that acknowledged me.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"They encouraged me, even!."
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"After that stream, I tried doing some by myself."
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I turned on the camera, put on something cutesy and started dancing to *Kira* Miki."
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"At first, I pretended the camera wasn't there but as soon as I saw the comments..."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Something snapped within me.
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Lewd comments, praises, the usual random stuff..."
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"After seeing so many people interested in me, I started moving a lot more. No more shyness for me."
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"After that I started doing more. I sang, I cooked, I drew things, I even did a striptease at some point."
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Whenever I was streaming, I stopped being shy."
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"So, at some point I said, ""Hey, this is the way I wanna live all my life""."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,And thus Streaming-chan was born.
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it difficult to keep that up?
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Not really. It's not like I'm acting or anything. I'm just being myself.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I do need to mind camera angles and that kind of stuff sometimes, but it's nothing major."
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And when do I need to mind that? For only $99.99 a month you can find out. Go Premium, Go!"
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...hey! You're good at this bartending stuff. Look at all the things you've made me say.
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Like, seriously. What's your secret?"
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,How do you get people to talk?
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I never do that much, actually."
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, this is a bar after all."
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And one of the reasons people come to a bar is because, they sometimes want to get things off their chests."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,So it's not a conscious trick you could teach in a ten minute tutorial?
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nope.
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You just need to be in the right place at the right time.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some professions make you that personal stranger others feel comfortable telling their secrets to.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...of course, discretion helps too."
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hey, now that you mention it, I do blab a lot to my hairdresser."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Pretty interesting stuff.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, no wild night tonight. But it did get interesting enough."
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Anyway, I should go. But before I leave, what's your name, Ms. Bartender?"
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I'm Lana Smithee.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Alright, Ms. Smithee. Thank you for a lovely night."
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But you stay here! Because the night is still young and there's a lot to do!
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Whoa! The floor is moving...
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Quite the lively girl, eh?"
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,People like her physically hurt me with their presence...
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You think she'll come back?
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My mom always says, ""You never know when the angels are saying 'amen'""."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What does that mean?
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It means shut your mouth or you'll jinx it.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Why didn't you give her your name?
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Would you like to reveal your name to someone like her?
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Good point...
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm gonna take my break now. It's been a while since I've needed a cigarette this badly...
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,All done.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Feeling better?
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fresh air does wonders for you.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, for a given value of ""fresh"", anyway."
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I insist that it sounds like dynamite.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, it was too long to be dynamite. It sounded more like some heavy-duty tool."
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're a heavy-duty tool.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yes, I am."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Wait, that... dammit!"
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, welcome back."
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I could've sworn this place looked a lot more... pink the last time we came. Maybe it's the lighting.
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hey, bartender. What did that noise just now sound like to you?"
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I say it sounds like construction, but Betty here says it's dynamite or something like that."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not you too...
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Eh? Do you think it's dynamite then?
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What? No, I say it's a backfire."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,It's a gunshot.
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Firecrackeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeers!
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* See? Those sounds have been going on all night and we can't figure out what they are.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, we aren't here to discuss that. We're here to..."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Um... who is he?
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Gillian. Nice to meet you.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I don't know, you have more of a John face."
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Where was he last weekend?
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, and I don't care. He already made amends for leaving me to fend off all those dogs."
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, what do you want?"
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Beer.
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, what the hell. I'll have a Beer too."
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Two Beers coming right up.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thank you.
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Man, after-work Beer is always the best Beer."
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Thanks, but this might be too much."
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'll take care of anything you don't drink, don't worry."
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, I see."
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You want to see us fight for the Beer, don't you?"
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, I'll have you know that I can leave this guy begging for mercy."
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Oklahoma! Take the Beer.
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Flawless victory.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll regret this but... Oklahoma?
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It's my safeword.
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Figured as much.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Aaaand, we're off to a good start."
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"We're not the dogs, Bartender. You can drop your guard."
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"So tell me, bartender..."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just call me Jill.
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Jill? That's a nice name.
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,How's business lately?
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,As usual.
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, I guess you don't really know what ""usual"" means for us."
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... we're not the kind to be filled to the brim during rush hours and we don't have that many regulars.
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... it's just the same. Nothing's changed.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I guess when we came here with all the dogs, it was quite the change of pace, huh?"
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You have no idea.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Um... I have a question, Jill."
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it about the girl sleeping next to you?
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,*grumble* Mmmmm... Premium...
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please don't wake her up.
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Do you regularly let people sleep here?
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, but I'd rather have her sleeping than talking."
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Should you be saying that with at least 6k people listening?
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let them hear. I don't care.
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,6k people?
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She calls herself Streaming-chan. She's been streaming her life 24/7.
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That sounds familiar... I think one of the dogs talked about seeing someone doing that.
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I don't know if it's the same person.
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"So, six thousand people are watching and hearing us?"
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Considering the way she's sleeping, they're probably only hearing us. Her camera is against the table."
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know how many are still in the channel, though..."
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I see.
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"So, there will be a lot more witnesses if something's said?"
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do any of you have a criminal past?
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Nope.
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Just a minor charge of petty vandalism.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did you do?
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Painted graffiti outside of my high school saying ""Ms. Thompson's a cunt""."
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why'd you do that?
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Because Ms. Thompson was a cunt!
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She constantly humiliated whoever got her questions wrong.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She also constantly bullied two of my classmates!
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"True, I got a week of suspension and had to clean the wall."
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But it gave everyone the courage to speak up!
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what brings you here today?"
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I suggested coming here after work.
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's Friday. A drink to kick off the weekend is one of those little things that makes life worthwhile.
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But he did only suggest it after I found him hugging a stuffed Corgi in his office.
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A... stuffed Corgi?
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,A plushie. Not an overfed dog.
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, you have an office?"
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, what's weird about that?"
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I thought you'd have a cubicle... or a kennel.
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,A kennel...
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, you don't hear much about office boys getting their own offices."
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's not hard, considering the rest of the staff don't use chairs or tables. Even I have my own office."
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know about that. The mess they left in the bathroom usually requires someone with thumbs.
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Chairs and tables seem like lesser evils.
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you're the veterinarian after all...
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,A kennel...
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,What about a kennel?
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I don't know, I just thought it'd be cute if one day I went to work and they had one waiting for me.."
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Like they saw me as one of them.
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... w-where did you get that plushie?
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, I gave it to him."
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It was my gift last Mega Christmas.
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wait... so he got defensive over being caught hugging a gift you gave him?
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's the funniest part. He acted like I didn't know he had it.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I was just glad he was enjoying it, you know?"
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Why are you two talking like I'm not here?
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Because you're not giving any input anyway.
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how's stuff up at Doglandia?"
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, we recently struck a deal with Farmer Fabrics to start a doggie clothing line."
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Farmer Fabrics? That name rings a bell...
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's that textile company where the owner believes herself to be an alpaca.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... yeah. That one.
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We had her here some time ago. She got drunk and...
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...so much saliva everywhere.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Oh...
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"B-But anyway, dog clothes?"
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,We hired a new employee and she showed the higher ups some designs.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"After a couple of talks, they decided to give the clothing production a try."
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Those designs were embarrassing, you know?"
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But something tells me that's why they were approved.
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You guys want anything else?
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'm still handling this Beer, so I'm fine."
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're such a wuss...
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'll have a Zen Star, please."
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Zen Star.
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thank you.
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Oh... kay then...
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'll take it.
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You don't expect me to pay for this, do you?"
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'll have whatever this guy orders.
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Let's see... I'll have a Brandtini.
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Two Brandtinis, then."
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You have such a... wimpy taste in drinks, Deal."
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Not all of us spent their weekends in college partying like maniacs.
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Actually, not all of us went to college."
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You missed nothing. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time and kick myself.
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Hey! Why are you taking the Brandtini?
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Because I said I'd have whatever you ordered and that's what I got.
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That... doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Whatever. I'm still grabbing this one.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Fine...
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...you need more of a spine or you won't find a worthy woman.
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Next time I'm really grabbing your drink.
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,O-Oh...
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You know, I COULD storm off right now and it'd be entirely within my rights to do so."
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But... I'll pass this time.
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Shouldn't I be the outraged one?
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But you aren't.
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's true.
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Seriously, though, you need to stop being so... passive and quiet."
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're only assertive when dogs are involved.
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,But I like dogs.
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,If you were at a restaurant and the waiter took a bite out of your order...
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...would you just sit quietly because no dogs were involved?
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Um...
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I've seen you stand quietly as someone else takes your spot in line, you know?"
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah. Last time that happened, you got too involved and left the poor guy a crying mess."
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"The same way you don't get how I can be so passive, I don't understand why you need to be so hot-headed."
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Seems like it's too much effort for stuff that, honestly, I just don't feel is worth the energy."
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They disrespect you.
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Trust me, I'll act when I feel they've crossed a line. Until then I'd rather not stir up a mess."
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Do you have any idea how much that attitude annoys me?!
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But who am I kidding, if you were a girl, I'd find that attitude adorable and be all over you."
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's... quite the double standard...
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hm...
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Something on your mind?
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That girl that's designing the clothes...
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Laura? What about her?
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"She's cute, but she should take more care in her appearance."
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, right now she fits the ""unkempt cutie"" category so well that it's almost painful."
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's so cliched that I can't help but cringe when looking at her.
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Cringe?
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's like when you see something that's such a cheesy movie cliche...
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...you just feel the need to kick whatever the hell it is.
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,K-Kick?
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Betty, I didn't think I'd have to say this to you twice in the same month but... you shouldn't kick people."
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I wasn't gonna kick her. Why'd you think I'd kick her?
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Because I've seen you kick people before.
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Apparently unprovoked or due to complicated reasons only you understand.
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Fine. Guilty as charged.
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Still, I'm gonna do something about her. I feel like I just need to."
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's a matter of honor.
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Honor, she says..."
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, maybe honor isn't the right word."
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But she has potential and I'm not going to let her waste it.
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Jill, I'm gonna go check the antenna on the roof."
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"She's your boss, right?"
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Didn't you meet her before?
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Nope, I'm just the veterinarian. The dogs were the ones that organized a meeting with her."
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'd say she's really good looking. But honestly, those pants rob her of her charm."
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you mean?
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"They make her look too uptight... and at a glance, she doesn't seem like the type."
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Some shorts or a skirt would fit her better.
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, she wears a skirt or pants depending on her mood."
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There was also this one time where she came in wearing a kilt.
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That kilt was awesome!
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Damn, she has nice hearing.)"
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Now that I think about it...
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You have that hobby of speculating what someone's personality is like based just on their looks.
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I mean, you did the same with Jill here."
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Amazing, you actually made that sound weird as hell."
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yes, I have the habit of trying to guess someone's behaviour based on their looks."
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"No, it's not a hobby. You made that sound like I'm some sort of creep."
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I-I did?
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did you think about me?
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Nothing much, really. Mostly that you were too polite."
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Not a natural polite, though. More like a professional polite. You're like that because you need to be."
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That was it, really."
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Although the way you looked at me when I said your boss could use a skirt or shorts was interesting.
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You seemed... interested in what I said. Like you'd like to see that scenario.
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're thinking too much.
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What do you think about Gil, then?"
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hm...
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hmhm...
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,He's either a total simpleton or acts like one in a way that consumes the rest of his character.
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Heh... heheh... yeah...
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But anyway, I'm just a veterinarian."
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,My judgement might be clouded by seeing so many furry businessmen.
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Let's have another round.
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sounds like a good idea. I'll have...
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You'll have something strong. You need to pump some testosterone into your taste in drinks.
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You'll thank me later. Trust me.
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then...
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Two strong drinks. Manly drinks. I don't care which ones.
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Well...
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You shut up.
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Now, drink."
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Nf...
801,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, man up. You'll get used to it."
802,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
803,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Okay, then..."
804,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"No, you get this one and I'll have the softer one."
805,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,*sigh*
806,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
807,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You're not helping me, Jill. It's better he learns how to drink like a man now rather than later."
808,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Phew...
809,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hey, you piece o' scrap. There's something I need to tell you."
810,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Hm?
811,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You can listen too, Phil. I know curiosity kills you."
812,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Phil, she says..."
813,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Okay, here we go..."
814,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That girl, Laura? She's head over heels for you!"
815,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Laura?
816,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She's the one that's designing the dog clothes.
817,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah.
818,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Huh...
819,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Just ""huh""? That's all you've got to say?"
820,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,What? Do you want me to blush and act flustered and shy?
821,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yes!
822,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can Lilim blush?
823,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Just the non-heavy duty Social Development types... and I'm of the heavy duty kind.
824,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Damn it!
825,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Anyway. It's fucking obvious she's all over you, you know?"
826,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The way she steals glimpses of you... how she looks around for you whenever she enters a room...
827,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh man, youth is awesome."
828,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You could be reading too deeply into things.
829,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like when you read your horoscope and start searching for supporting evidence throughout the day.
830,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Shut up, Will. *yawn* It's love and I know it."
831,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
832,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Are you tired?
833,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Three of the dogs thought it was a good idea to eat plastic foil...
834,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,One had a paw stuck in a jar...
835,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They're like kids sometimes.
836,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sleep a bit. I'll wake you up when we leave.
837,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thank you...
838,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That was fast.
839,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Exhaustion and alcohol. What can I say?
840,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay?
841,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'm still fine, yeah."
842,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I ask you something about the whole Laura thing?
843,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sure.
844,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If she WAS interested in you, what would you do?"
845,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's a tough one...
846,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"First, there's the whole problem of workplace romances."
847,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I also don't know her very well. In fact, I'd be lying if I said I remember what her face looks like."
848,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What's the tough part, then?"
849,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, if I rejected her, that would hurt her, don't you think?"
850,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How do you handle that?
851,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
852,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Tough question?
853,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I was just thinking that people say a lot about the fear of rejection but not much about the fear of rejecting."
854,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, it's not like she'll go tell you her feelings just like that."
855,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If she were to suddenly declare her undying love, she'd either be joking or a total nutjob."
856,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, don't worry about that right now."
857,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, you're right."
858,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Will Betty push her towards you, though?"
859,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Nah, she'll forget everything in the morning."
860,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Speaking of which, we should be going."
861,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Goodbye.
862,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
863,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Betty, wake up. We're leaving."
864,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yesh mom...
865,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hey Jill, has someone ever proposed to you as a prank?"
866,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
867,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You know, make you think they're falling in love with you just to reveal that it was all a prank."
868,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
869,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Jill?
870,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,First year of high school. The guy I had my eyes on for a whole year had asked me out.
871,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Saturday morning, I go to the meeting place. What do I find? It was all a prank by some bitches."
872,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Ouch...
873,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sorry, I-..."
874,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The worst part isn't that they set me up, but rather that I saw it coming."
875,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I knew that guy wouldn't find me attractive enough to ask me out.
876,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I knew those bitches would target me sooner or later just for kicks.
877,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I knew it all, so when it all happened I felt nothing."
878,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They confirmed my suspicions that teenagers are a plague that must be eradicated.
879,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
880,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
881,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, why the question?"
882,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...hey, piece o' scrap."
883,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah?
884,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,These are the situations where you should've stopped me before I said anything.
885,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It's better to learn by tripping yourself.
886,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Why the question, though?"
887,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,U-Um...
888,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was asking because one of my exes' cousins has been hitting on me the past couple of days.
889,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"If it were somebody else, I'd pretend to be straight with the help of this piece o' scrap here."
890,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sadly, she knows who I am."
891,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Worst part is, knowing Vero, she probably put her cousin up to it as a practical joke."
892,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I'd suggest telling the cousin that she should cut it out."
893,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If she feels genuinely offended, they might not have been in cahoots."
894,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I'm just spouting nonsense based on what you've told me. Don't pay too much attention.
895,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's better than my suggestion.
896,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What was yours?
897,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Waterboarding.
898,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I se-... what?
899,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,The fact that she knows how to waterboard somebody is what scares me most.
900,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"The Girl Scouts also taught me how to skin a deer, and I see nobody making a fuss about that."
901,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But yeah, your advice sounds good enough."
902,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Especially when you factor that if Gina's being honest about her, she probably won't feel offended."
903,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Gina... Which one was that again?
904,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Blonde, flat as a cutting board but cute as a button."
905,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh yeah... she came to the office Christmas party, right?"
906,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's the one.
907,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, it's getting late. We should be going."
908,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah.
909,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Thank you again for everything, Jill."
910,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Bye.
911,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
912,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Back.
913,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Those damned cats moving the internet antenna...
914,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh yeah, Gil. Some guy said I should tell you that ""the bunny's late""... whatever that means."
915,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, shit..."
916,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Boss, I'm leaving early. If I don't come back in two days, consider me as good as dead."
917,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yeah, yeah..."
918,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shouldn't we be worried?
919,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Think of him as a kid that tells outrageous stories to get attention and everything will be easier.
920,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Besides, he knows how to take care of himself."
921,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
922,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He'll be here on Monday like nothing ever happened.
923,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"In any case, I'll be back in my office. Maybe now I can finish watching that didgeridoo tutorial."
924,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hello, Jill."
925,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Stella. You're here for another drink today?"
926,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Not really. I was just around the neighborhood, and..."
927,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Right...)
928,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"A-Anyway, I found this bottle being neglected at my house."
929,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And thought someone who likes old liquor as much as you would appreciate it.
930,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? I-I don't know what to say. Thanks!
931,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, it's nothing, really..."
932,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,This just in!
933,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
934,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,"The Apollo Trust bank has locked its doors, leaving about 30 people trapped inside."
935,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,The security system was activated after somebody tried to steal information from the main database.
936,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,"Early this morning, the bank..."
937,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Oh, gods... SEI!"
938,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
939,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder if she'll be alright...
940,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,This just in!
941,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,News? At this hour?
942,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,"The Apollo Trust bank has locked its doors, leaving around 30 people trapped inside."
943,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,The security system was activated after somebody tried to steal information from the main database.
944,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,"Early this morning, the bank..."
945,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Damn... that's rough.
946,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, hello Jamie."
947,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Good evening, Jill."
948,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Did you see the news about the Apollo Trust bank?
949,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The newsflash just ended.
950,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds like things got ugly.
951,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"From what I heard, there was a commotion earlier today."
952,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Something about people being unable to leave the building.
953,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Let's hope for the best.
954,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
955,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil stormed off just a minute ago, though."
956,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I see. I guess the bunny was late.
957,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(He definitely knows what's going on.)
958,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
959,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Give me a Marsblast.
960,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
961,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One Marsblast.
962,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Yeah, this is the one."
963,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Marsblasts have always seemed poorly named to me. Shouldn't it be red instead of yellow-ish?
964,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Then again, the whole ""Red Planet"" thing is still its nickname."
965,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ugh. Sorry, I got it wrong."
966,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"No problem, just be careful."
967,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Did the news distress you, Jill?"
968,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A bit, yeah."
969,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,VR... can't believe I'm... *mumble* myself...
970,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Hey, who's this girl?"
971,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She calls herself Streaming-chan. She's been streaming her life 24/7.
972,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm guessing her equipment's still running, so you might want to watch what you say."
973,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Thanks for the advice.
974,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Changing the subject a bit, have you been hearing explosions or something throughout the day?"
975,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I heard that a supersonic drone was undergoing tests and lost its course. That might be it.
976,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Aaaaah...
977,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, boss! The explosions were caused by supersonic drones!"
978,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That sounds better than firecrackers!
979,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We've been trying to figure out what they were all day.
980,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Ah, I see..."
981,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Sonic booms are not sounds people can normally identify.
982,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,And this one drone made a lot of noise when breaking the sound barrier.
983,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is this an area to test that kind of stuff?
984,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It's not. Which makes the whole thing quite suspicious..
985,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh.
986,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Man, if only Gil was here to hear that info. He thought they were gunshots."
987,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Are you worried about him?
988,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sort of. He always leaves without notice for days, but he always comes back unscathed."
989,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'd be lying if I said I'm not worried, but at the same time, I've just kinda become used to it."
990,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"He can be a troublesome man, huh."
991,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sometimes.
992,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how have you been doing?"
993,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I was working a contract, actually."
994,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,But the target's inside the Apollo Trust bank. Figured I'd simply leave him be for now.
995,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And then you came for a drink.
996,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Yeah.
997,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A part of me wants to ask who your target is, but I'm guessing it's a secret."
998,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I can tell you that it appears to be part of a power struggle somewhere.
999,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Has a target ever made you a counteroffer to go after the one that sent you?
1000,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They usually don't live long enough. I also don't like it when a target who's seen my face manages to survive.
1001,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
1002,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,What happened?
1003,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"N-Nothing, I just suddenly thought... what if someone sent you after me?"
1004,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I'd reject the contract.
1005,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You would?
1006,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I don't ask the name of many people, you know. And I always remember those whose names I've asked."
1007,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They're real in my eyes.
1008,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I like to know them better and, to some extent, I care about them."
1009,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I need that because otherwise...
1010,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Otherwise...?
1011,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...nothing you should concern yourself with.
1012,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,But don't worry. Unless you suddenly find yourself caught in the middle of a power struggle...
1013,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The only way I see you becoming tangled up in that kind of mess is if you find yourself too involved with gangs.
1014,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks for the advice... I guess.
1015,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, the thought of people hiring others to kill somebody is..."
1016,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I can't wrap my head around that, and I don't want to either."
1017,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"The world can be a dark place, Jill."
1018,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Say... do you think the people in the bank will be alright?
1019,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"This isn't the first time a bank has closed like that, but something is... off about this."
1020,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Off? How?
1021,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I don't know. Maybe it's the hour. Maybe it's the fact that the news is making an unusually big stink out of it.
1022,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Let's hope I'm just overthinking it.
1023,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
1024,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Are you worried about something?
1025,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A girl that was in here yesterday said she was going to that bank.
1026,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not like me to be personally invested in what happens to clients, but..."
1027,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nevermind. Do you want something else?
1028,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'll take my leave here, actually."
1029,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I've still got business to deal with even if my target's trapped in a bank.
1030,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Take care, Jill."
1031,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
1032,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Yeah, I can make time for one more drink."
1033,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Fetch me a Beer. Let's keep it simple.
1034,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
1035,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
1036,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I once read that Beer played an important part in humanity's history.
1037,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I'm familiar with the theory. It's an interesting one."
1038,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The gist of it is that brewing was an important part of society during its development.
1039,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Drinks were ubiquitous while feasting. They helped to foster bonds and build faction alliances.
1040,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Given enough time and enough Beer, larger societies would be born."
1041,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,You seem to know a lot about this.
1042,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, just enough."
1043,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
1044,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Jill, this isn't Beer. You can't let your worries cloud your judgement or the quality of your work."
1045,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah...
1046,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Jill, have you ever thought about brain uploading?"
1047,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Brain uploading?
1048,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I was thinking, what's the point of uploading yourself if you're still ""here""?"
1049,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Let's say you upload yourself and, effectively, that new someone's in cyberspace. You will still be ""here""."
1050,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Wouldn't it be weird to know that there's a you that's not you somewhere?
1051,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's... an interesting point.
1052,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I guess it'd be the same as cloning, huh? Imagine if your cyberspace self found out about the real you, somehow."
1053,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hell, imagine talking to your other self."
1054,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,There's more. Imagine placing multiple copies of you in different situations.
1055,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Exposing each one to different scenarios to see how they develop.
1056,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess it is kind of heartbreaking in a way.
1057,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Imagine someone with some illness uploading their brain into the ether.
1058,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Only to find out their physical bodies are still alive and ""here,"" instead of living in a place where there is no disease."
1059,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I remember an article from a while back about the earliest forms of brain uploading.
1060,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It would scan the brain in such a thorough and intense manner that it would effectively kill the person.
1061,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It used the words ""burn the brain""."
1062,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ouch...
1063,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,All for nothing because the data would be corrupted or broken.
1064,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They halted all brain uploading research after that.
1065,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I think they started another project about living brains in jars or something after that.
1066,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That subject interests you, huh?"
1067,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It makes for a nice time sink when I'm doing nothing.
1068,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Last time you came, you mentioned something about going haywire."
1069,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did you mean? I'm intrigued.
1070,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Have you ever felt like your sanity has slipped right by you?
1071,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, a client earlier tonight was driving me nuts, but aside from that... no."
1072,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Truth be told, neither have I. But I'm afraid of it happening."
1073,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
1074,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I don't know. I just have the lingering fear that at some point I won't be myself.
1075,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'll go crazy, I'll wake up a stranger to myself and I won't care..."
1076,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It's just an irrational fear that lingers in me and there's nothing I can do about it.
1077,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Like the fear of cockroaches for some people.
1078,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Only instead of fearing a crawling nuisance, you fear lunacy..."
1079,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Something like that.
1080,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Sometimes I wonder if uploading my brain would solve all those problems.
1081,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, that technology is still a ways off."
1082,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've heard of a couple of experiments regarding the technology, but it seems everything's still too buggy."
1083,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'll have to wait until it's safe, then..."
1084,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Until then, don't worry too much about those possibilities unless they're tangible enough."
1085,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Otherwise, you're no better than a hypochondriac."
1086,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Good point.
1087,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The way you said it makes it sound less like something you feel might happen.
1088,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something you're just afraid COULD happen at some point.
1089,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"That's pretty much it, yeah."
1090,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Doesn't that make you saner? I mean...
1091,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Were you really on your way to becoming an unhinged maniac, I don't know if you'd think about it at all."
1092,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Hm... you might have a point there.
1093,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, how did... how did you get started in the whole gun-for-hire thing?"
1094,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is there a stormy past?
1095,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Hm... that's a good question.
1096,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
1097,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It's not like I'm an amnesiac or anything like that, but many parts of my past seem to be blurry or vague."
1098,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I can remember my parents but not their names.
1099,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I remember I went through compulsory education, but not what I studied in college"
1100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"...or, for that matter, if I even went to college at all."
1101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I seem to have had a fairly normal past, but I get the sense that something happened along the way."
1102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Doesn't that concern you?
1103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Not really, no."
1104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I am who I am right now and that's all that matters to me.
1105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I won't go putting feelings where there aren't any.
1106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sounds like good advice, regardless of context."
1107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I have this theory that it's all from back when I got expunged from nanomachines.
1108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Something must've hit my brain and made things blurry.
1109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Not quite damage, but almost."
1110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Well then. Nice talking to you, Jill."
1111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Same here. Always a pleasure.
1112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Say hello to Gillian for me when he comes back.
1113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
1114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Phew... all done.
1115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You want to stay here? Seems the street's quite restless.
1116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thanks, but I'll pass. I have a couple of matters to attend to at home."
1117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You do?
1118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I ordered a Nanocamo module for my apartment. It should be installed by now."
1119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Nanocamo? Isn't that a tad expensive?
1120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup. To be honest I asked my mom for it.
1121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She had been pestering me about what gift I wanted for Mega Christmas for a while.
1122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's been asking that for four years now and I've always said I was fine.
1123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I... took the chance and asked her for it. Used up all the past gifts.
1124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Oh.
1125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Feels a bit weird to ask your parents for a gift like that when you're 27.
1126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm sure she doesn't mind.
1127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"So, what will the Nanocamo module change from your apartment?"
1128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I got the basic plan: Walls and one piece of cloth. So I picked my kotatsu too.
1129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You have a kotatsu?
1130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know what a kotatsu is, Boss?"
1131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm more impressed you know what it is.
1132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I mean, futons are common knowledge, but a kotatsu... not so much."
1133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, well. Days get cold and the heater might not be enough."
1134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And the Japanese have mastered how to live comfortably in reduced spaces.
1135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You should invite me sometime, I wanna see how you decorate the place with that."
1136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Let's plan a day to grab a Beer, yeah."
1137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,No more... dancing... *mumble* I'm tired.
1138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do we do with her?
1139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll take care of everything, don't worry."
1140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright. Sorry for leaving her like this.
1141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,No problem.
1142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I gotta go."
1143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"See you tomorrow, Boss."
1144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Careful out there.
1145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah... the lovely sensation of feeling like you're forgetting something.
