2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah. Hey, Jill."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,How are you feeling?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I won't say good but...
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not that bad, I guess."
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's nice to hear.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where's Gil? Did he run away again?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Nah, I have him on errand duty, buying the drinks for tomorrow."
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That sounds... weird, coming from the owner of a bar."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Every drink from here would come out of our own funds.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"So if we're gonna spend money, we might as well get more variety."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Besides, those kind of walks are always good for Gil."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're the boss.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who's coming so far?
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, there's the three of us, the dogs, you invited titty hacker, Gil invited Jamie..."
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh yeah, I also invited Dorothy when I called her to spend the night with you."
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds good so far.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Invite anyone else you feel like inviting. The more the merrier.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I could, but I bet everyone's made plans by this point."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's true.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll be in my office, call me should anything arise."
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Wait here. I'll check inside.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Oh, a BTC bar."
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Excuse me. Do you know where the Athena Convention Center is?
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why does that place make people get lost so easily?
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They should have called it the Minotaur Center.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,...
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hold on, let me scribble the directions on paper."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Thanks.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...go to the right... when you see a building filled with hobos...
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This should be it.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Thanks a lot.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else I can help you with?
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Hm... eh, what the hell. I'll have a drink."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,What about you?
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"A Brandtini, please."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Thanks.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Something's not right here...
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's an interesting outfit in this cold season, Miss..."
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Well, I'm actually cosplaying so... call me Vella for the time being."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And your Lilim friend is...?
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...Essentia.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I get it. You're cosplaying too?
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,"Sure, let's go with that."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Have you heard of a game called YIIK, bartender?"
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That cult classic game that has seen like three remastered versions made by six different companies this year?
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,That one. We're in a cosplay group dedicated to it and we got lost on the way.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I heard you talking to someone outside.
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Oh, yeah. A friend is cosplaying as Alex. I told him to wait outside."
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shouldn't he enter?
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,He'll be fine.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Something amiss?
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...there's a girl behind you.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,"...short hair, black sailor uniform, missing an arm."
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...wearing jeans under a skirt.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Now, now. Don't spook the bartender."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,Spook?
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else?
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,I'll get a Fluffy Dream and be on my way.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you?
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,...I'm fine.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Yup, this is the thing."
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,*sigh* Whatever.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Damn, I got dizzy pretty fast. I better stop here."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"...now that I think about it. Just who are you, um... Essentia?"
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Isn't she your friend?
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,I guess? I don't know.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,I just kinda met her in a convention and she stuck with me ever since.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,She also seems off. Like she's missing something or thinking too much.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Essentia,Interference. Slow synchronization.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,"Well, I won't hold you any longer. We should go."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Goodbye.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please. Come again.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Why the hell are you on the floor?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Tased? By the vending machines?
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder if he said something to piss off Didi or Gogo.)
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Seriously though, should you leave your friend outside like that?"
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,He'll be fine. He started chatting with one of the vending machines.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,They were talking about R&B music.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Does your friend prefer the 1980's R&B or the 1970's?
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,1980's I think.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh shit...
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss! Didi! R&B!
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm coming!
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Um...
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You see, Didi is a 1970's purist."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He has tased people for even liking 1980's R&B before.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He got tased!
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Oh god.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He'll be fine. Vending machines have very weak tasers.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He'll be confused for a couple of minutes, but that will be that."
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You should go check on him though.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Vella,Right. Thanks again for the directions.
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,*sigh* At least it wasn't Franco-Belgian comic opinions this time.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(""Black sailor uniform""? I hope I'm just overthinking it.)"
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(...more importantly though. ""Jeans under a skirt""?)"
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh! Hey, Dorothy."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"O-Oh. Hi, honey."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay?
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I just kinda wandered in here. I guess I'm a bit distracted.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Can Lilim ""just wander""?)"
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you something?
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh! Uh... a Sugar Rush. Yeah, that."
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One Sugar Rush.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Seeing her down is so... weird.)
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One Sugar Rush.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks...
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hey! This has no alcohol!
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I got a reaction out of you, didn't I?"
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh...
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,This is...
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Didn't you say you liked having a Piano Woman whenever you felt like celebrating, or were feeling down?"
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I did?
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Wait... I did! You actually remembered such a thing.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You're so sweet~
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I was half expecting her to say that she meant a literal Piano Woman. Glad I was wrong.)
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks...
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(She didn't notice it was the wrong drink?)
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(So much silence...)
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"By the way, thanks for staying with me the other day. Turns out I really needed that."
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, did you enjoy the soda?"
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, did you find that one out?"
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Was it supposed to be a secret?
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,No... but don't go around telling everyone about that.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I did it because it was you who needed my help, but a hug night is usually one of my most expensive services."
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It is?
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, I don't know if the client has body odor or something like that."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Not to mention it limits the chances of getting any other client that night.
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Still, did it help?"
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, it helped me cool down a lot."
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, from what Dana told me, someone close to you died, right?"
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you wanna know more about it?
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you wanna tell me about it?
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've brought it up enough times already, I think."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,No problem then. You were sad and that's all I needed to know.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sorry for the loss though. I mean it.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although I've wondered for a while, do you Lilim really understand death?"
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Sorta, kinda..."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Our whole database is constantly being backed up in the Collective Source.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Even if our bodies are destroyed, we can be deployed again with our personalities and memories intact."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So... our concept of ""mortality"" might be different."
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,We do have a fear of death though...
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You do?
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,We can't even begin to understand the idea of not being redeployed.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"While we have built-in ""warnings"", the mere idea of that... nothingness is paralyzing."
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"There are a few that don't mind it, but we do fear death and we don't wish it on anyone."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"In fact, that was the argument used for abolishing the whole three laws thing."
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You seem quite knowledgeable about robot history.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Seeing what others have done to make sure I can live like I do helps me not take things for granted.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Seriously though, those laws were bullshit."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""Can't harm humans, can't disobey humans unless it's about hurting them..."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"...and you can protect yourself as long as it doesn't harm humans."""
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I mean, sure. The first AIs were just helpers and tools."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But how could those laws still apply to them after they achieved self-awareness?
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Who in their right mind would abide only by rules inscribed in some old book?!
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If I remember correctly, those were only the distilled versions of the ""laws"" some writer imagined over 100 years ago."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They were a reduced version of all his ideas.
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"However, many authors afterwards took to them like they were the very laws of physics, or something."
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And like many other things, people distill and exaggerate what they need and use it to their favor."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Wow, you're a nerd."
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Look who's talking.
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's change the subject a bit though. Mood's getting gloomy.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Your apartment is very comfy, you know?"
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a tad small though. Sorry about that.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And your cat is so cute! What was his name again?
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fore.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why Fore?
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I figured if he ever got lost, at least I wanted to be able to yell ""FOOOOOOOOORE!!"""
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It happened once. You'd be surprised by how many golf players you run into.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And every time you play with him, you can say it's Fore Play. He-he. He."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pfft... yeah.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He was also named after... someone.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really? Who?
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Lilim kid that wanted to transcend.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What? A movie character or something?
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, let's go with that."
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...?
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want anything else?
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hmmm... Let's go with a Blue Fairy.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why do they call it a Blue Fairy?
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Is it because of Pinocchio?
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I believe the name is based off Absinthe, which some call the Green Fairy."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The first versions of the drink were described as ""Sweeter Absinthe""."
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sadly, they had to fix the formula because people were turning green."
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Not blue?
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A blue-ish green.
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"This isn't a fairy, you know?"
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a spirit though.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Still not a fairy.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Nope, not even that."
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You seemed to have cheered up a bit there.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yeah, talking to you always helps me get my mind off things."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, there's something I've wondered for a while now."
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What?
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of friends do you have?
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, are they in your same line of work or...?"
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Friends? Aside from you?
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank you.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hm... well, there's Lawrence, that vending machine is a lot of fun to be with."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"...once you get past his... quirkiness, that is."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I've also met a lot of nice people working in the streets.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,From the top of my head I can think about...
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Nightingale, another Lilim. He changed himself to have fur and a more wolf-like face."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,He's also a pretty good pianist. He plays in a jazz band on the weekends.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"There's also Nadeera, a drag queen and the owner of a club I've been invited to a few times."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She has an animal shelter on the side. I help her with it occasionally.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, there's also sister Clementine, a nun from an orphanage."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I go there sometimes and play with the kids.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Whoa, that's something I didn't expect to hear."
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...I also almost got adopted once.
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I was flattered, but it was... weird."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, and it turns out I already knew your boss."
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Some years ago she...
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She what? What?!
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...I said too much. Client confidentiality and all that.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, enough tangents. Why were you gloomy in the first place?"
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Gloomy?
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When you came in. I don't know if gloomy is the right word, but... you were pretty quiet at the very least."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And knowing how you normally are, it was pretty weird."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, don't worry about that. Just had one too many things going in my mind."
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I wasn't gloomy or anything. More like... distracted, really."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's see if you know me that well. Give me something I'd like.
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Good! But that's cheating. You just served me this drink.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still right, isn't it?"
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup.
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"This one's pretty basic, huh?"
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,First drink ever created on this system. Still a favorite of the people up till today.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Can't blame 'em.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about this?
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup! Juuuuust nice.
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You always order either sweet or girly drinks. It was a no-brainer.
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Girly and Sweet drinks for a sweet girl.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Bzzzzzt! Wrong.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I still love you, but this is definitely wrong."
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I still can't believe you actually remembered what I said about the Piano Woman.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's always good to keep note of what regulars like, you know?"
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've wondered for a while though. Why do you keep coming back here?
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"For you, of course."
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Come again?
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Why else would I come, if not to see you?"
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You're one of the few people willing to hear me out, always filled with curiosity."
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And you're cute. Talking to cute people is always nice.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"There's also the bar, the way it's insulated from the noise of the city. It's really comfortable."
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And it's just a bit away from the street I'm always at. A win-win situation!
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It was weird to see you down though. Especially since you're always so lively.
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, I wasn't down, really. I was just thinking about a lot of things."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like what?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, my mom, er... guardian asked me to go home on Monday for a bit."
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And as much as I love her, being with her is usually... tiring."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Guardian""..."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That whole thing about someone taking care of a Lilim after they're deployed until they reach maturity, right?"
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup. And I'm proud to say that I reached psychological maturity in just one year!
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They always try and keep a varied pool of volunteers to make the Collective Source grow faster.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what's wrong with your guardian?"
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, she still treats me like a kid."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The worst part is that sometimes I fear she might see me as some sort of replacement for her dead daughter.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh? Dead daughter?
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I was deployed to her not long after she lost her daughter. A contrived coincidence, really."
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Even when I was still developing Self-Awareness, I always feared she might be using me as a replacement."
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"She didn't though, or at least not consciously."
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"At times she would just stop doing something, or return a gift she's given me..."
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,If she felt like she was projecting too much of her daughter onto me.
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"What irony that years later, I'd make a living pretending to be someone else in the bedroom."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How's that?
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, most of the time, my job involves role-playing. A daughter, a student, some helpless kid..."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It means I've gotten many clients looking exactly for that, but on the other hand..."
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"From a professional standpoint, I'd rather have them hire me because of me."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Because of my character, not because I'm ""The one that roleplays as little girls""."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Maybe I need to exaggerate some attribute...
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What's the problem with your guardian then? If you do that on a daily basis, why worry about it?"
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Because I don't wanna make her sad.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Every time I visit her, I fear she might look at me and see her daughter. That seeing me makes her sad."
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"At this point, I don't even care if she's projecting her daughter onto me, I just don't wanna make her feel sad."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you try talking with her?
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,How so?
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Telling her just what you said to me. Clear up those fears.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, unless she's not the kind to want anyone opening up to her, that is."
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I... never really thought about talking to her about that.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It doesn't sound like something you just bring up though.
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Keep it in mind, at least. Maybe she'll appreciate the gesture."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wouldn't know though. I haven't met her.
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"She's a really nice woman. The problem is mostly with me, I think."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, I think I'll go now."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Thanks for lending me an ear, honey."
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My boss told you about the party tomorrow, right?"
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup! I wouldn't dare to miss that.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Alright then. See you tomorrow!
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good luck.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks!
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And that's that.
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, I'll be taking my break."
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well then, I'm taking my break."
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh... I'll be leaving then.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, what I was trying to say is that I'm taking my break, you wanna come?"
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you don't mind talking on a chilly night in an alley behind the bar, that is."
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Eh, I've done worse in alleys."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's go!
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss! I'm taking my break.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright!
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want one?
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Are you really offering a little girl a cigarette?
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,NOW you're a little girl?
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I always am. Innocence, however, is another matter entirely."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But anyway. Thanks, no.  Smoking seriously messes with my air filters and they're a hassle to replace."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Don't mind me though. Smoke to your heart's content.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, why don't you tell me about this guardian of yours? I wanna know what kind of woman she is."
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sure!
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, her name is Sophia Graem."
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(G-Graem?!)
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She's a retired P.E. teacher. Nowadays she works at a gym during the morning shift.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"She's pretty fit, if I do say so myself."
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She had a daughter. Apparently she suffered from Nanomachine Rejection all of her life...
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"...and when she finally healed, she was hit by a truck."
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... what was her daughter's name?
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I don't know, I never asked really."
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Are you okay? I'm reading fear... or is that surprise? It's hard to tell.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm fine yea-... wait, ""read""?"
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, I don't ""see"" emotions like you do."
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I have to make do with a combination of body heat readings, face recognition and context."
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm still a bit confused about some, but I've gotten better with time."
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Anyway, you sure you're fine?"
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Scared or surprised... she's not wrong though.)
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, does that mean your last name isn't really Haze?"
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Haze is just my artistic name. Sounds more exotic and that's what people usually look for in this business.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I tried other names though.
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Dolores Haze, Genesis Graem..."
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I tried Dorothy Warrior once, but a legal team came out of nowhere and stopped me cold."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what's your legal name, then?"
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Rebecca Dorothy Willow Graem. A bit of a mouthful, if you ask me."
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So Dorothy's actually your second name?
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Should I call you something like Becky then?
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,People have always called me Dorothy rather than Rebecca for some reason. That's why I chose it.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It's useful too. People have tried to falsify stuff using my name and they always get caught.
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Because they use ""Dorothy Haze"" as their name?"
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup.
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Only my mom... err... guardian calls me Rebecca, so it's weird to hear it from others."
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about Willow?
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Willow's my first surname, actually."
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"When I got registered, my guardian was married to a guy who had ""Willow"" as a last name."
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Shortly after I joined their household, they separated, so I was left with his family name first."
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hold on, so your real name in short would be ""Rebecca Willow""?"
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Doesn't have the same pizzaz to it if you ask me.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Whatever you say, Becky."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Stop it!
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It'd be like if I called you Julianne all of a sudden.
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,NGH!
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Whoa, that was anger I read just now. Lots of anger."
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I think it's weird enough already if you call me Jill instead of ""honey""."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Weird, huh? How you can end up feeling associated with a name that's not yours?"
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I have an uncle that always called me Tina. He kept calling my cousin Tina ""Jill,"" for some reason."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Neither of us mind it, though. Because he's calling us what he thinks we're called instead of mixing us up."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...that and it's completely useless to try and correct him.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But you know, maybe that effect is true for your clients too."
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,How so?
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, you're worried about your clients not hiring you because you're... you, right?"
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But think about what happens when it's announced that a character will be played by a different actor.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, it's a character, but people are also going for the actor playing the character."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,So you're saying they go for MY roleplay instead of just mere roleplay?
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds too far-fetched?
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Sounds plausible, actually."
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Okay honey! I'll take my leave now. Don't wanna take up all of your break.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks for the chat. See you at the party tomorrow!
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bye.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Back! Did I miss something?
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Unless you count the worst PPV main event fight I've seen all year? Not really, no."
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Going out?
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll have a word with Gogo outside. He was so hyped for that match. He must be devastated.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, hi Sei."
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Good evening, Jill."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How are you doing?
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"The nightmares have stopped, so I'm sleeping better."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... how about your injuries?
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My bones are healing nicely. My wounds finally closed... the scars itch a bit, though."
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, that's good to hear."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you by yourself today?
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, I'm running a couple of errands by myself today, but I wanted to come here for a while."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I also notice the big guy from last time is outside.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Buster? Stella doesn't want me being alone while I'm still healing, so she suggested taking him with me."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Something cold.
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah! This is the one.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why drink something cold when the weather outside is so cold too?
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It's not that cold, actually."
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"But I've always had decent tolerance for the cold, so I'm not a good reference."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think you'll like this one.
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Really?
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Heheh... so sweet of you.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thanks!
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Thanks, but.. ummm..."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It isn't cold.
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry. It's so chilly. My idea of cold is a bit off.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, Stella isn't with you today?"
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She's throwing a Mega Christmas party tomorrow and is having a meeting today.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm just helping her by checking on some of the things she ordered.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And here I was, all ready to invite you to the party we're throwing tomorrow."
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You're throwing a party too? Sorry about that! Can't really say no to Stella.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Maybe next time?
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(If there's a next time at all.)
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal.
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-I want you to know that I want you to have a good time.
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Have fun! Drink a couple of Beers in our honor!
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Heh. I will, then."
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are Stella's Christmas parties like?
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,They're really big. There's lots of food and drinks and music...
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Sometimes there's too much food, though."
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"So at the end of the party, she lets the staff take home whatever's left."
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She also buys toys for all the children of her staff members.
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"She says something about taxes or whatever, but during the whole thing, she just... shines."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She carries a beaming smile that I don't see any other day of the year.
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Many of the kids have even started calling her ""Auntie Ella""."
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh...
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Stella always does her best to put up a tough girl facade, but she's very much in touch with her inner child."
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Christmas, Easter, Halloween. Name a party and she most likely celebrates it big."
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Interesting.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Do you like parties, Jill?"
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't mind them. They're a good place to see people.
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not one to actively look for parties to attend, though. I just... don't mind going to them."
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Ah, I see."
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I only go to parties that Stella is attending. Because otherwise, I'd just stand there without anything to say."
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"That and... I'm not one to wear dresses, you know?"
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not?
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm a tad too ripped. They don't look cute on me.
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Although, with all this healing I have to do, I won't be as fit for a while."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,They're too... um... breezy too. I feel like I'm wearing nothing.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"But I bet you'd look good in a dress, Jill."
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's been years since I last wore one. I wouldn't know.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Last time I wore one, I remember worrying my arms were too thin or something like that."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"We all have a complex, huh?"
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I mean, even Stella has her own."
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's... hard to imagine.
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh, but she does have one. She distresses a lot about her bust size."
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Really? She's not that small. I think I'm smaller than her, in fact."
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Actually, it's the opposite. The opposite kind of complex, I mean."
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She's a bit self-conscious about having a big chest.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...again, I've seen bigger chests than hers, to be honest."
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Although I guess comparisons are useless here. They rarely help with complexes.
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, she does go the extra mile to hide it."
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"In fact, I have no idea how she does it."
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I mean, I've seen her before and after she tucks them away, but... I guess I never cared enough to ask the specifics."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"That's also why when she goes out, she styles her hair in those... um..."
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Drills?
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"They look a bit drill-y, don't they?"
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She styles her hair like that to help divert attention away from her chest.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She seems affluent enough, why not go through a reduction surgery?"
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Because she also kinda likes having that size.
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She takes her bust size after her mom. And Miss Carmine is quite proud of her chest.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"""Puffing out your chest is a sign of confidence! And a bigger chest means more confidence to show!"""
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She says something along those lines a lot.
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Stella has quite the admiration for her mom, so I guess breast reduction would feel like betraying her?"
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm making it sound like she's hiding J cups or something like that.
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I guess in a taller or thicker person, her size would be normal. She's just a bit shorter or thinner than the norm."
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Do you get self-conscious about your bust size, Jill?"
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not really. I've been more self-conscious about my height.
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Although it usually comes up whenever not being average height hinders me somehow.
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about you?
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yes and... no?
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It's not my bust size, but rather that I look too manly sometimes."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,And I can't help but wonder if bigger boobs would help with that.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're fine, don't worry."
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thank you.
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything else?
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hm...
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Do you have something non-alcoholic?
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I do. Gimme a sec.
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thanks!
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're not one to drink that much alcohol, are you?"
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It makes me feel sleepy or, at the very least, makes my legs go numb."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It's an annoying feeling, to be honest."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thanks!
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um... you sure this isn't alcoholic?
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah...
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It might be expired, then."
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Seems safe enough. Not gonna make it go to waste.
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It makes me wonder what's so good about getting drunk.
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I mean, I'm not above it, but it's not exactly a pleasant feeling."
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You feel like you're sleepy even when you're not...
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Your legs go numb. Everything starts sounding funnier than it really is...
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,What's so good about not being able to control yourself?
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's... a good question, actually."
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Usually people like feeling numb because that numbness helps them forget their problems.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Even if we don't talk about alcohol, there's a portion of people that can't afford food..."
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Or who are suffering from some pain that only alleviates when drunk or high.
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It doesn't sound really logical on paper, but then again, humans are rarely, if ever, logical creatures."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Despair and pain cloud your judgement and make you do stupid things sometimes...
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah... I've seen that firsthand.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,This world has an ugly side nobody deserves to be a part of.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's also a matter of addiction, you know?"
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You start just liking the drink, but then you need more of it and before you know it, you're hooked."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh yeah, that too."
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't like things going to waste?
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"That's something that stuck with me, thanks to Stella, actually."
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"She's not a cheapskate by any means, but she's a bit obsessive about making sure things don't go to waste."
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,No food goes to the trash bin.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"She always gives it to her pets, or makes fertilizer out of it if no one else is gonna eat it."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It can get annoying when you try to peel a vegetable or fruit near her.
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"At best, she scolds you for not doing it right."
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"At worst, she rambles about the nutrients in the skin and makes you cook it without peeling it."
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"So, any time I see something that might go to waste, I can just... HEAR Stella scolding me for it."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, you'd think it'd be the opposite."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I can't speak for other rich people, but Stella's family has always been really down-to-earth."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"They do indulge in expensive things from time to time, but otherwise they're pretty simple people."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Maybe that's the reason I've been friends with her all this time. I doubt I would've been able to otherwise.
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"So tell me, what kind of party are you guys throwing?"
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nothing fancy. It'll just be me, Boss, Gil and a couple of regulars."
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They'll bring food. We'll chat for a while, and that's it."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Man, that sounds so good."
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,At least better than the whole planning madness Stella is throwing right now.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"If you ever throw something like that again, you let me know, you hear?"
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Sei..."
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah?
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you plan on doing now?
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm gonna check one last errand before going home.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I mean... what do you plan on doing now, with the White Knights disbanded and all?"
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"To be honest, I don't know."
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I never prepared a Plan B because I figured, if you can go with a Plan B, why not just make it the Plan A?"
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'm not the brightest person, so I never graduated from college or even high school."
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I could go for a position with the police, but it wouldn't be as thrilling..."
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...and I'm tired of blatant corruption. Sick of it.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But I'm alive.
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I learned something after that hell in Apollo Trust.
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Life is not something that you can just throw away easily.
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Clawing my way out of that place made me realize just how much I wanna be alive.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"The body count left in the bank was ridiculous, but I'm still here."
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I don't know what I'll do, but I'm alive. I'll figure it out sooner or later."
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's nice to know.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, I gotta go."
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Bye Jill! Good luck with the party!
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh. Hi, Mr. Detective."
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Ah. Hey there, girl."
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Give me a strong drink, won't you?"
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yes, this'll do."
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Not strong enough, kid. I ain't paying for this."
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(You could at least try not to look happy saying that.)
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what brought you here?"
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Nothing special. I was just working on a case and I happened to be in the area.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of work?
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Tracking someone... a gun-for-hire.
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about the girl? Crimson something.
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I am tracking that girl.
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Didn't you just get out of that job?
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I did, but the guy offered a huge amount of money and... well... I just couldn't refuse again."
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, it's your life. Not mine."
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I wonder, though. There has to be more to that whole thing than just acting as middleman to look for some murderer."
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Hm...
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Say, how safe is this place?"
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We're protected by the BTC property laws, the walls are soundproof..."
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...and I really couldn't give less of a shit about selling info to anyone.
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Okay, then... wait. Soundproof walls? Why?"
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you see those vending machines outside?
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They're quite talkative, the bastards. It'd be annoying without those walls."
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Alright then.
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Have you heard of Lord Lance Lavender?
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nope.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,He's some big name from Kanyevania. His blood apparently has some weird reaction to Glitch City's nanomachines.
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Once in contact with the air, it does nothing."
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"But if still fresh and touching someone's blood, the nanomachines will initiate a reaction."
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Essentially, they'll just eat through the other person's body until there's nothing left."
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,They're using him as a guinea pig to see what causes that reaction and if it could be used to fight Nanomachine Rejection.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh-huh...
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Well... turns out the Crimson Rose is his daughter.
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,She left years ago to earn her living here and he hasn't seen her ever since.
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He could be lying, you know?"
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Doubt it. I did my research. She really is his daughter.
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why didn't you figure that out earlier?
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I had no clue who was making the contract, and tracking all the messages to the source would've been too costly."
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Knowing who the sender was made things easier.
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything else?
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Hm... what about a Cobalt Velvet?
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Oh... you actually did it.
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Were you expecting me to mess up so you didn't have to pay?
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,N-No...
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,HA! Wrong drink!
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Don't be. Free drink!
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So what made you accept the contract, anyway? Keeping in mind all the risks you told me last time?"
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"He told me he wanted to see her again one last time or, at the very least, deliver her a message."
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He could've been lying.
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yes, people lie. You made your point."
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Even then, I felt like I couldn't say no."
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I mean, I know what it's like not being able to find your daughter..."
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"What it's like to be apart from her, not knowing what she's doing or even if she's alright."
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You do?
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I have a daughter. She's about your age.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"When she was a teen, we had a big fight and she ran away from home."
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"At first, I just waited for her to show up. But then I started getting worried and went out to find her."
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I couldn't find any trace of her. Nobody had seen her. Soon, I was worried if something might've happened to her."
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I guess that's how my tracking skills and list of contacts began to grow.
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I finally found her, taking cover in some dumpster, unconscious from starvation."
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"So yeah, I just couldn't say no to his request of finding his daughter."
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,But I don't expect you to understand.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how's the search going?"
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I'm very close to finding her... that girl's pretty good at covering her tracks.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Compared to the her from before the bank incident, though, she seems slower, somehow."
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Either she's let her guard down or something else is happening.
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What will you do when you find her?
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I have this letter I'm supposed to deliver to her.
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I don't know what it says and I don't want to find out.
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What if she tries to kill you?
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I might not look like it, but I can take care of myself, bartender."
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You don't stay so long in this business without picking up a couple of tricks.
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I guess you're right."
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Okay, I better go back to work before her trail goes cold."
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you done?
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Okay then! I want you here tomorrow at 8 P.M. No working beforehand. The bar will be closed tomorrow.
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Come dressed in your absolute best! We're having a party after all.
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Where's Gil, by the way?"
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He stored all of our things in his home because of how close it was to the stores.
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,So I told him to go home already and bring the stuff tomorrow.
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, see you tomorrow, Boss."
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hold on, wait a bit and I'll go with you."
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, sure. Thanks."
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I need to remember to buy more cigars.)
