2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Are you okay?
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I feel like shit.
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You sure you should've come then? You're in all the right to stay at home.
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I have to come.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I threw away everything I had in my life to be here.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,People I loved were pushed aside just so I could enjoy my freedom of being here.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My stupid, stupid freedom..."
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So I will come here until I die, even after the bar closes, until my hair falls out."
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You're the one who looks like she's about to fall apart.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Your eyes are red and swollen.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah? Well... your hair is... hairy!
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yes, it is."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Agh! Who was the dipshit that changed the order of the glasses?!
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"It was me. I was the one washing dishes yesterday, remember?"
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, I was too busy staring at my crumbling life and all that."
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Why don't you go home, Jill? You're in no position to deal with people right now."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Go home, rest a bit."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My girlfrie-... my ex-girlfriend died and I wasn't there to see her one last time.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"All because of a fight I spent all these years regretting and wishing to, but never actually apologizing for."
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My decision to assert my freedom and grab a hold of my life led me to this.
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bartender strapped for cash that distanced herself from her loved ones for no other reason than selfishness.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So I won't fucking leave. I threw all of that away to be here, so here I will stay!"
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is what I wanted, this is why I left all of that behind, this is why..."
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,See? You're starting to sound like a broken record.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, leave her be. I'd rather have her here than be alone in her apartment."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"How are you feeling, Jill?"
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I feel like a shit-eating piece of shit.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm the lowest of any possible life form you might find.
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nanobes look down to me in disgust, knowing they're far superior."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You're spirited, that's good."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where's the mutt?
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Working with CIRA.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"""At"" CIRA."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I know what I said.
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"In any case, let Jill process her anger. It's perfectly normal to feel that way."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"And here, she's surrounded by people that care about her."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's a lot better than leaving her to fend for herself.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I mean, as smart as Fore might be, he's still just a cat."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Then why not have Jill stay, but not serve anyone today?"
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What part of ""I won't leave"" didn't you understand?!"
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I didn't leave everyone behind to just sit and do nothing!
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Fine, fine..."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,*sigh* What do we do if she lashes out at a client?
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"That's why you're here, Gillian Pliskin."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Who?
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hey Jill.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll be in my office, but if you need a break or a hug, just tell me."
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, you already put on music."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,*sigh* This is gonna be an interesting day.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"The hall of heroes keeps shining. Brimming with the... *sniff* Do I smell tacos? Wait, it's outside. Nevermind."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, hell no."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"We meet again, bartender."
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...Virgilio. What can I get you?
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Today, the luminous pollution on the streets makes it seem almost like a starry sky."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"And when I think about stars, I think about celebrities. Celebrities are fishy and my favorite fish is the octopus."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,So I want something octopus-like.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Aren't you... gonna do that weird bartending thing?
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm waiting for you to order like a decent human being.
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I'm not following.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Spell out your order like you're a human who is not in need of medical help.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Fine then, I want a Sparkle Star. S-P-A-R R... kle Star."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,See? Was it that hard?
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Have you TRIED to spell under pressure?
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,This isn't an Rkle Star.
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Whatever.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"You look angry, Spelling Bartender. Are you having that time of the month or something?"
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I'm just filled with ridiculous amounts of anger, pain, and self-hate, and..."
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...on second thought, you're not that far from the truth, I guess."
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I get those too, you know? Periods."
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...you do?
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yes. Last month, I finally got over my Renaissance and moved to my Enlightenment."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And here I was, thinking you'd get to say something serious for once."
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Are you implying I'm not serious?
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Glaring holes through me will do nothing. I'm glare-immune!
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,But if you allow me to give you a sincere piece of advice...
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...whatever. It's not like it'll help.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You shouldn't kick yourself so much.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"If you keep it up, any chance of finally forgiving yourself will someday be gone."
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Self-hate will leave you with a hole that will never heal.
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,So please take measures against it instead of sulking so much.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I'll be damned. That actually sounded half-sensible.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And here I was thinking you were just a pompous lunatic.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Hey! Pompous lunatics have stories too!
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? What story?
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I... would rather not tell.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Figures.
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You want anything else?
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Have you ever seen how the...
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,A-A Bad Touch.
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yeah, I guess this is the one."
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"This is the problem with antagonizing the bartender, eh?"
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Maybe he's right and I shouldn't be so hard on myself.)
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Even though I deserve every second of it.)
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(If only I had apologized earlier, I might not be feeling this way right now.)"
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(If only I... i-if only I...)
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I... I can't even remember what held me from apologizing all these years.)
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Um... bartender. You're making lots of faces there.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Pride? Fear? What kept me from going out and apologizing to Lenore?)
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I can't even fucking remember what feeling kept me from fixing this whole situation?!)
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Can't I at least find solace in whatever feeling it was that brought me to this situation?!)
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Great, now I'm feeling even worse thanks to not being able to muster whatever feeling held me.)"
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I-Is she okay?
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"No, but just leave her be for now."
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hey Jill!
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...eh?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, thank god. A normal person."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,WAAAAAAA! A Mummy!
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"No, no. I don't have kids."
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...still more normal than this twat.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"How are you feeling, Sei?"
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My bones are still broken, but at least the cuts are healing nicely."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thank god I'm not someone that scars easily.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um... I mean wounds don't leave me marks. It'd be a problem if I couldn't get scar tissue.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What happened to you?
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Fell off two and a half stories into some trash and rubble.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You look better, though. Last time you came, you looked like you were about to collapse emotionally."
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Heheh... I guess.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"...you're the one who looks like it now, though."
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"How do I put it... it's like when I called you your full name, but magnified."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, don't mind me too much. I'm in a bad mood."
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Anything I can do?
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please forgive me if I suddenly lash out. At you or anyone else.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want something?
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My tongue's not so sensitive today, so let's have a Beer."
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you?
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Such a change in tone.
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I-I'm fine. I don't need anything.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yay! Let's see if there are any differences from the canned ones.
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...and?
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,This one tastes... less watered down.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,This isn't what I ordered.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,D-Don't lash out at me!
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I won't. Sorry about that.
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"So, did something happen to you?"
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm fine, nothing's happened to me."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,People who are fine don't act like that.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"...oh! I get it. You're in ""those days""."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"When it's that time of the month, I get a bit sulky."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I'm not on my period."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,No?
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* I'm dealing with the loss of someone, okay?"
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Oh!
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...sorry.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Maybe I shouldn't have come today after all.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Um...
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"No, I..."
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hm...
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Maybe...
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Agh!
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you alright?
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-I'm trying to find something to say...
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Making a joke would be tasteless, and I can't say everything will be alright without it sounding... cheap."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm... at a loss as to what to do here. Sorry.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh...
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wanna hear something weird?
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was exactly like that when Stella came here on Monday talking about you.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Oh.
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, ladies. I'm leaving."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...Virgilio.
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Yeah?
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You were just sitting with a Valkyrie.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Really?! Splendid! This'll make a good entry in my poems blog.
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* I'd feel bad about the way I treated him today.
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...if not for the fact that he was being cryptic with his orders for no good reason.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Like Stella when she first came?
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes... NO!! I mean...
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Heheh...
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You could've given him a free Beer or something and apologized.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. I just keep messing things up with people.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But you know? He seemed familiar.
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Familiar?
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, I can't put my finger on it though. I just feel like I've seen him somewhere."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Ah well, it might just be that he looks like someone from an ad or something."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what brings you here?"
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I wanted to come with Stella. So I'm waiting for her.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why here?
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"To be with you, of course!"
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That reminds me. How did Stella react when you arrived?
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She slapped me... real hard. It hurt.
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"She said ""That's for making me worried and not listening to me!"" and then she became happy."
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Can I ask whose loss you are dealing with?
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...you shouldn't be bothered with it.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just pretend I'm in a bad mood and call it a day.
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh, okay."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you really want to know, huh?"
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I can't help it! I don't like seeing people sad. I just need to know context, not details."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Someone to whom I said some mean thing to passed away before I could ever see her again.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Does that work?
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah. Sorry.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Knowing I can't do anything helps me calm down but...
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,E-E-EH!! I mean... it's not that I wouldn't help! I just...
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Calm down. I get it.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I can't contain myself when I see people in need.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But I've learned that there are times when you just can't do anything... and that's kinda fine.
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Thank god I learned that, otherwise I would've gone insane ages ago."
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're a good person, Sei."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Nah, I'm just an annoying girl."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Still, if there's anything I can do to help, let me know."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I have broken bones but that doesn't mean I can't offer emotional support.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You could always order another drink.
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Oh yeah! That! Let's do that.
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Get me something cold, please."
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's pretty cold outside though.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, but I don't like hot or warm drinks."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,They make me feel nauseous.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,This isn't cold... but maybe my idea of cold is different from yours.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You know what cheers me up?
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Singing. Hearing people sing helps too.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you sing? I mean... did you take singing lessons or something?
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Nope. People have told me my voice is pretty nasty, actually. But they've also told me I'm good with the harmonica."
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you play the harmonica?
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I needed something to do some breathing exercises with, and a harmonica is a lot smaller than a tuba."
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"And I guess if you practice enough, you become decent."
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's something I didn't expect.
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I hear that a lot. I know I don't look like the musical type.
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I used to play the violin. Right until I was... 16 or so.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Really? Can you still play?
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The violin's at my mom's house, so I don't have it with me."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I guess I could. It's one of those things you don't forget easily.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Why did you stop?
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know. One day, I just felt like stopping. No deep reason behind it."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Just like me and cooking!
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,That... and almost burning my place up.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,When's Stella coming?
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Now that you mention it, she's a bit late. Let me call her."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You do that, I'm going to take my break. Tell Gil if you need anything else."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Sure!
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Back.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Looks like you've calmed down.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I still feel like kicking myself, make no mistake."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...but I guess I cooled down a bit.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sei helped a lot with that one, though. I just can't stay mad when I see her."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Speaking of which, where is she?"
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I believe she went outside to look for that Stella girl or something.
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"The way you are right now, it feels like I should be protecting you."
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hey! The only thing hindering me is the broken arm. I've gone into burning buildings with a 2cm deep cut.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, I remember that one. 1mm more and you would've lost the motor function in your arm."
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Ah. Hello, Jill."
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's this about protecting who?
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, um... I'm sort of like Stella's unofficial bodyguard. But I'm not really fit for such duties right now."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,My father insists I go everywhere with protection. So most of the time I only ask Sei if she feels like going out.
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,She's trained to deal with the kind of things that bodyguards deal with anyway.
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And she's more fun to hang around with too.
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I'm assuming that gorilla outside is a bodyguard?
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,That's Buster. Pretty cool guy. He played football professionally until he lost his leg in a demolition derby.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"We've offered him an implant surgery for all his years of service, but he rejects it every time."
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, he got used to the replacement he's using, so maybe it's for the best."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It's a thick oak branch on a metal bowl tied to his stump.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,And yet he can still run faster than me with it.
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,True.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want something?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'm fine right now.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,A Brandtini. A big one. I'm in a good mood.
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"After all these years, I still don't get why the finest and most expensive things come in small packages."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Ever tried to go to a restaurant only for them to serve you a really small portion of some fine food?
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sometimes you just want to... stuff yourself with really cheap food.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Sei, let's go for some hamburgers later. I'm not taking a no for an answer."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I know what you mean when you say ""some"", you know?"
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You might as well call the place and tell them to prepare everything in advance.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I guess this means my good mood is halved now.
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Can't you make up the other half with the fact that I'm here alive?
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Aaaaand the good mood's gone.
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's two of us.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I ask you two something?
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Sure!
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I guess.
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did you two meet?
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Stella showed up in the park I used to play at when I was a kid.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,We played a couple of times. She started showing up more and more and that was it.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"*ahem* My father told me that, when I was 5, I kept insisting on going to a ""real kid's park."""
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"We drove for some time, and the park I liked was the one Sei happened to be at."
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Have you ever seen a girl in a dress go to a muddy park?
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She learned her lesson and started showing up with more fitting clothes.
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"But man, that's a scene I can't forget."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you two have known each other for most of your lives?
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I've known her longer than I've known my own father.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Why the question?
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No reason. You two just look so comfortable with each other. Any other person could've sworn you were an item.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,A-An item? What kind of item?
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"...a couple, Sei."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh! Ite-... yeah, I get it now."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"It's funny because we actually earned a mock prize of sorts for ""best couple"" at Stella's high school."
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...Three years in a row.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you two didn't go to the same high school?
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Nope.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Don't you have any childhood friends, Jill?"
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Childhood friends... can't think of any. My grandpa, I guess."
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What kind of man was he?
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gruff. The kind to eat raw Bronson roots every morning.
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*brrrrrr*
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But around me he, was... different."
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I have memories of him barking orders to my dad, only to turn around and play with me gently."
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's interesting though. He was my mom's dad. But after my mom and dad separated, he stayed with my dad."
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But yeah, he's the one that comes to mind when I think about childhood friends."
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Ooooooh.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Hey Jill, what's this... Bloom Light?"
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A spicy drink. Tastes nice the first time but it gets same-y after a while. It's also brown for some reason.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Gimme one of those, please."
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'll have one too.
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I don't know. I kind of like it.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, but after the third one, it starts tasting like sand."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Spicy sand, but sand nonetheless."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Here you go. You have this one.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,What are you gonna drink?
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,This other one. Bloom Lights taste like sand to me.
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I-Is this right?
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,First time I'm glad someone messed up my order.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Who's *yawn* dimming the light?
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Zzzzzz...
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Huh... I guess she had too much before I came.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, that, and that she must still be tired."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,From the whole bank thing?
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She told me about everything that happened in there. To be honest, I don't think I would've made it in her place."
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I guess I should be thankful for the nanomachine treatment she went through as a White Knight.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Treatment?
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Trauma suppressors.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Basically, it helps with the healing process of PTSD."
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's mandatory for every White Knight, regardless of division."
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Still, healing can only do so much."
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"For three days, that bank was hell. And poor Sei is still paying for it."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The disbanding of the White Knights and subsequent persecution of those who were identifed as former members...
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's unfair, you know? Among all the people using the White Knights to further their own goals..."
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sei was one of the few that actually believed in what they were supposed to do.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It paid off though.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The doctor who treated her wounds was the same one she's always assisted with accidents and emergencies.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He treated her at no cost whatsoever.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, good karma and all that."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She's earned the gods' favor, I think."
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...but you know. All of that made me realize I might be a bad person.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How?
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"When I saw Sei, wounded, asking for help; a part of me was happy."
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"After all this time needing her, she finally needed ME."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I felt truly useful to her for the first time.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*sigh* How sad is that?
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sometimes the best help one can provide is to stay alive.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who knows? Maybe it was the idea of coming back to you that helped her.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I guess you wouldn't be human without thoughts like those once in a while.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Maybe.
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything else?
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm good. I should be leaving actually.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Come, Sei. Let's get hamburgers and go home."
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,*mumble* Yeah...
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Sei, come on. We need to go."
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,*yawn* My mouth's dry...
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,We'll be leaving now.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank you. Please come again.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You know? Your grandpa reminds me a bit of Mr. Sirius.
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,My father.
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Stella Hoshii's father is Sirius Hoshii...)
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"He's all like ""Sell all the stock before the month ends!"" and ""We both know that's not the best price he can offer!"""
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Then he starts talking with Stella or me and he becomes all soft spoken and calm.
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, what did you expect? If he behaved like that during business meetings, they'd eat him alive."
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh yeah, you do that thing about behaving differently when in business meetings too."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, she acts like a shallow sochi... so... sooo... cialight...?"
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"""Socialite""."
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah! That thing.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Care to elaborate?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"My dadd-... er... father, told me since I was very young to ""cultivate a shallow, dim-witted, daddy's girl persona""."
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"""They will lower their guard thinking you're just another rich daddy's girl. That's when we strike!"" He said."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Everything about that it's an act... except the daddy's girl part.
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You are the biggest daddy's girl I've seen.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,S-Shut up!
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"But yeah, Mr. Sirius is one of the nicest guys I've met. Although Ms. Carmine isn't too far behind."
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ms. Carmine's your mother?
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Yeah. Disappointed her name isn't star-themed?
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... n-no.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I really owe it big to her though. She got my mom some really good clients. Good enough to let her semi-retire, even."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Your mom isn't too far behind though. Being a veterinarian requires quite the thick skin.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, she got bitten enough to develop one."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You want anything else?
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I want a Beer.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You sure you can handle that?
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'll be fine.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'll have a Beer too, then."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Cheers.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"*sigh* You take the Beer, Sei."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You sure?
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You wanted one, right?"
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,R-Right... cheers!
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I don't see a Beer.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Sure, I have problems with depth, but I don't see a Beer."
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'll still take it though.
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I guess that's it for today.
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh! Before I forget. You look... calmer, Jill."
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess you helped me cool off a bit.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,That means I helped? Yay!
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Anyways, we're off!"
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Good night.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,...now if you'll excuse me...
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Zzzzzz...
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And that's the cue for us to leave.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Buster! Please carry Sei to the car.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Stella?"
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Yes?
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care of Sei. Don't lose someone like her over something stupid.
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"...sure, I wasn't planning to anyways."
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Goodnight, Jill."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Jiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiill, you smell gloomy!"
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Smell?
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You usually just LOOK gloomy... but today, your face is making me feel down!"
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What happened to you?!
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Stella, it's time we left."
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'll leave after she tells me what happened!
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Let's just say I said some mean things to someone and now I can't make amends for it.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,IIIIIIIIIIdiot. You're an idiot!
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Stella!
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"If you said mean things and you're sorry, just say you're sorry!"
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,A friendship isn't worth a bit of pride!
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh...
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Now we're leaving.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Learn from your mistakes, Jill!"
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,B-Bye...
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Come again.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Learn from your mistakes""... I guess that's all that's left."
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,*yawn* Maybe we should... leave...
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Seeeeeeeeeeei! Wake uuuuuuuuuuuuup!
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Bars aren't a place to sleep!
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Buster! Get Sei in the car!
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,We're out Jill.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Feeling better?
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I just don't reek of rage."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I still feel like a piece of shit.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Little steps, I guess."
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Hello?
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Kim. Welcome."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I was afraid I'd mix up the directions and end up in someone's house or something.
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I'll have a Sunshine Cloud, please."
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks!
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,This isn't my order... did I arrive at a bad time?
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how's work on the webpaper?"
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Oh, I quit."
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what?
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Yup! I went to the office of that chauvinistic horseblower and told him I quit!
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why did you do that?
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"*sigh* Well, after I got drunk and overslept, I missed some assignments."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,My supervisor yelled at me for being late. I got the mandatory bullying...
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,So at some point I just kinda snapped and said that I didn't have to put up with that.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,So I quit.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... Sorry again about that by the way.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Oh, don't worry. I should be the one apologizing."
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Lashing out like that the next day and all.
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I arrived early to my meeting and got some assignment.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I spent hours doing it, only for the other bitches to come and ruin it."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"After that, I didn't have time left so my supervisor scolded me."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,So I snapped and quit on a whim.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't you have any second thoughts? Regret anything?
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I guess you'll always have second thoughts. Even if you do what you want, you'll still think ""what if""."
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Even so, I was getting physically sick there. I dreaded the arrival of every morning. I even almost..."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,...
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"What I'm saying is: I don't know what I'll do, but it's certainly better than being there."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I feel... free.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Free...)
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"It's a wonderful feeling, you know? I feel like now I can find something I care about."
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I won't return to The Augmented Eye, but I could still pursue journalism with another outlet."
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I haven't felt like this in... well... never!
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about your family?
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"They weren't happy, that's for sure..."
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"My dad took it better, but my mom freaked out, to put it mildly."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"""What are you gonna do?!"" and all that."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"*sigh* But I'm not here about that. Give me a big drink, please."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind?
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I don't know... bubbly or something.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"If detergent commercials are to be believed, this will clean out my insides."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It'll also kill things inside you.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"It's big but... ah well, I didn't care that much about which drink it was anyways."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I didn't particularly care about the drink this time around but...
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"...no, nevermind."
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I gotta ask though. How did you end up working there?
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,No deep reason. That's what I did when I got out of high school.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Taking a year off was out of the question so I went for the first thing I thought about.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"...but I couldn't get into the robotics course, so I settled for journalism."
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"...to be honest, I got tired of the job midway through it, but I couldn't bring myself to leave."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,*sigh* Too much pressure from my family.
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's a really common tale, I guess."
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Did you have troubles like those?
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Same story as you. I just... went through the motions.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"From high school to college, I never stopped to think about what I was doing."
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And then, at some point, I just felt like my life slipped through my fingers."
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Suddenly all I wanted was freedom, a little pause. To stop and take a breather."
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...and my life went to hell for that fucking breather.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Ehhhh... um... g-give me a... err... SOMETHING!
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Something""?"
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,S-Sorry. I just have a dry mouth. Anything will do.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright...
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks.
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,...
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I feel like I asked something I shouldn't have.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't fret about it. I'm just in a... rough spot right now.
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you gonna do now?
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Honestly... I don't know.
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I do feel liberated, however."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Like... I can do whatever I want. Study whatever I like, work wherever I want."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I know it's not that way and it won't be easy... but I feel a lot more confident than when I was out of high school.
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I honestly don't get why they put young people who barely know how society works through that one.
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I wish you the best of luck."
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your mental health should be your priority and all that.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks. I really needed the encouragement.
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Come back if you need more encouragement.
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wouldn't dare leave someone alone when it comes to this sort of thing.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks! Bye Jill.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You should take some of that advice for yourself.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I know, I know..."
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let's call it a day for now. You need some rest.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...yeah.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hoooooneeeeeeeeeeeey~
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Dorothy. Sorry, we're just closing."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I know. I came for you!
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,For me?
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,W-Why are you hugging me?
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I paid her to do that.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,All. Night. Long.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Come again?
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,To put it simply: Dorothy will go home with you and she won't leave your side.
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you hope to accomplish with that?
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, at first it was to calm that rage you had earlier."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It was either hugs or a cold bucket... and I don't promise there'll be any water in it.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You calmed down a bit. But honestly, I know better than to leave you alone for another night."
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"At the very least, all the cuddling will give you an epiphany or something."
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's some alien reasoning right there.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It's not. You need hugs. Many.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You need some human... err... humanoid contact right now.
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You had your alone time. Now, we're playing by my rules."
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Please take care of me.
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Stella and Sei make me a bit jealous...)
