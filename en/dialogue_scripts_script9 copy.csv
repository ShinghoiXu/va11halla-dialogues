2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, Jill. Good timing."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it? You two always make me feel like I'm late.
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"If it helps, that dog isn't coming until some time later."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, do you have something planned for Sunday?"
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Watch silly Mega Christmas specials with 1000 grams of black fur on my lap. Why?
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I was thinking about holding a small Mega Christmas party here this Sunday. You in?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure. Why not?
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright!
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Invite any client you're acquainted with. The more the merrier.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You didn't bring your cat today?
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The raids stopped. They found whatever or whoever they were looking for.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Huh...
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, we better start working."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yeah, you better."
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valha-...
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Uh... um...
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I want... a... Fluffy Dream.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"May I see your ID, please?"
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I don't have an ID because... um...
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I'm the ghost of Mega Christmas Past!
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I'll haunt you constantly unless you give me a Fluffy Dream.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you have money to pay for the drinks?
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Well, I..."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,DO YOU?
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Yes! I-I have money.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Wow, I actually got a drink!"
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Eugh... this... tastes like butt.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, who are you here to stalk, Miss Ghost of Mega Christmas Past?"
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Stalk? Oh right! I'm a ghost.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Uh... that guy! Yeah.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Which employee did you leave without a Mega Christmas, Gil?"
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Jill, please."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It would've been funny if he reacted to that.)
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry kid, I'm not in the mood to humor you today unless you have some sort of ID."
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,...here.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...well, in a year or so, I would gladly serve you a drink."
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But until then, this is no place for you."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,But I already got a drink!
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A non-alcoholic one.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You didn't expect me to really give you a drink, right?"
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Uh...
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, because you barely took a sip of the drink I made for myself."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You felt like a good samaritan and offered me to buy it from me so it's not deducted from my pay.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Isn't that right, Gil?"
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yup.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Hey!
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, if you ordered a drink, you could report me but you would have to admit to ordering it."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And that would bring you a different array of problems.
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,...oh.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, if you would please leave..."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I-I can't leave! Not after trying so hard to even get here.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, let's start from the beginning, Miss... Norma."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,How did you know my name?
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I saw your ID.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,It could've been a fake ID.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't think you're stupid enough to make a fake ID that DOESN'T put you at 18 at the very least.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,...!
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"You're very sharp, Miss Bartender."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You look like a nice girl, Norma. Why come to a bar like this?"
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Uh... um...
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"You seem like you're in a bad mood, Miss Bartender."
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Nah, she's just like that all the time."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Sorry if I've been harsh.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,These last couple of days have been... heavy.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And having someone underage here reminds me of a certain... incident from last week.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Incident?
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...don't change the subject, young lady. Why did you come here?"
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,What do you care?! I can do whatever I want!
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Unless it's illegal. In which case anyone can, should, and probably will stop you."
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,...
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"I just... just wanted to be more wild, you know?"
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wild?
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,My mom puts way too many expectations on my shoulders.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I've always been out to make sure I don't disappoint her.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,But it's never enough! It's not good enough to have good grades.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,She also wants me to go out and take a college preparation course.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,And I'm tired! I don't wanna do things for her anymore!
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you came to a bar.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Maybe if I came back home smelling like alcohol, she would leave me alone."
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"If I'm not good enough for her, I might as well kill any hope she has in me."
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You remind me of this client I had a while ago.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She... um... passed out in the street and my boss brought her here.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your attitude reminds me of how she got once drunk.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Huh?
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, bitter about the pressure exerted on her."
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hers was workplace pressure, but you still remind me a lot of her."
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,So what of it?
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, before you think anything else, calm down."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't want you to go through what she went through.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I-I'm calm...
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's funny. I have a friend who is also being pressured by her mother.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Really?
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but in her case, it's being pressured to settle down and form a family."
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Oh...
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, let me get this straight. You came here to make your mother disappointed?"
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Yes.
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you like alcohol?
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Actually, I think it's nasty."
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then you're doing things wrong.
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,What?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're gonna disappoint your mom, at least do it with something you like."
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like... become a belly dancer because you wanna be a belly dancer.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Otherwise you're just trying to hurt her for the sake of hurting her.
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's start with something. What do you like doing?
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I... don't know.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I've been so focused on trying to be good enough that I haven't been able to think about what I wanna do.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't you think you should start there?
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Eh?
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What good is doing something just for the sake of hurting someone?
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If she gets disappointed in you over something you like doing, you have the right to protest."
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But if you're hurting her by hurting yourself over something you don't enjoy...
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Sounds silly, huh."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Very.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Go home. Do some self-discovery before hurting your mom, would you?"
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Or at the very least, humor her until you're old enough to move out."
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Yeah, you're right."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"...thanks, Miss Bartender."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Call me Jill.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Jill? Alright!
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Careful out there!
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,In the end you did humor her for a bit.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Oh! A doggy!
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hello little girl!
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh shit.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,G and J! How are you doing?
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're late.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Missed me, J?"
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're too early.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, good to see you here."
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, will he be any good around here?"
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I'm right here.
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I know.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Of course, I spent lots of time training him. Why do you think he didn't show up last week?"
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because how the hell would I know you'd bring a PART-TIMER DOG?!
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Here, let me show you."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Sit.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,SIR YES SIR.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Roll.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,SIR YES SIR.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Paw.
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,SIR YES SIR.
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Training... of course.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He's only shouting ""sir yes sir"" and not doing anything else though."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...I never said I did a PERFECT job.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm? Is that a motorcycle?
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Oh shit!
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hey! Not in my office!
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"In the end, he's just a dog, I guess."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yes?
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...bathroom.
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, sorry. It's only for clients."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... um... promise me you'll buy something afterwards. It's that door over there.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Who the hell are you?
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The other one!
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sheesh...
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I said get out of my desk!
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,But the world's ending!
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It was just a motorcycle.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"They're the 4 Riders, then!"
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Those are horsemen, and it already stopped."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...thanks.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't mention it.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"I need to buy something now, right?"
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh no, you don't have to. Sorry if it looked like I meant to inconvenience you."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"No, I'll order something. I need a rest anyways."
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,A... Piano Woman... would be nice...
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, didn't hear you."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,*ahem* I'll have a Marsblast.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh... sure.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You look happy.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Shut up.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Yes, this is the stuff."
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...*COUGH* *COUGH*
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Too strong?
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I'm... *COUGH* fine.
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I guess this place is as bad as it looks...
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Is that motorcycle out there yours, mister...?"
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Call me Mario. And yes, it's mine."
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Sorry for the noise.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, don't worry. It's not like you stayed outside too long or anything."
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what do you work as, Mario?"
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"I live to paint the roads black with my wheels, leaving the trail of my engine's sounds wherever I go."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I'm a rebel. Fuck the red lights! Fuck the speed limits! Fuck the helmet laws! The roads are mine and mine only. I am-...
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Guys, I'm going outside with the dog. We'll advertise the bar."
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Hello doggie!
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hello shady guy!
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,S-Shady...
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll be back before long. Don't worry.
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Careful.
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Who was she?
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, she's my boss."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,She was cute.
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Err... not that you're not cute. And it's not like I'm into girls either.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Not that there's anything wrong with that, I just..."
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, where do you work, Mario?"
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"I told you, I'm a rebel, I..."
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Rebels can't maintain those bikes for too long. What's your DAY job?
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...I'm a delivery boy.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's really appropriate, I guess."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you deliver?
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"I'm from a courier company. So it's kinda like mail, I guess."
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I'm always around the city and I know it like the palm of my hand.
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Sure, I might not remember every building, but I remember every intersection and every street."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's nice. I still can't take detours without feeling totally lost.
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Try guiding yourself with the help of landmarks. Around here, the Saber Station's antenna is a good reference."
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Err... I mean... what do I care? Fix that yourself, b-bitch."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you want anything else, Mario?"
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I guess a Moonblast would be nice.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Moonblast?
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"EEEEEEH GUT PUNCH. Yeah, that... one."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Heh... this is good.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a Moonblast.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I...
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"No, nevermind."
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,A-Alright!
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wouldn't drink it so slowly if I were you.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,NGH...
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I guess I'm safe.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, Mario. Why do you try so hard to keep up that tough guy image?"
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...it isn't working?
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Maybe when you arrived and had to go to the bathroom, but after that you just looked... cute."
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Cute...
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, why do it?"
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Bikers are supposed to be scary, right?"
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Rebels that cause trouble and ride free from society's ties.
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If we applied that brand of logic here, I should be wearing one third of my clothes and lighting drinks on fire."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I guess.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can do whatever you want and dress however you want. It's just that you look like you're trying so hard.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like you don't really enjoy that.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...it's not a LIE.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who says you can't dress as a biker and still be a nice kid?
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Yeah, but other bikers..."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That sounded like something someone in high school would say.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Ugh...
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* It's just advice. Don't take it too personally.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"No, you're right. I don't have to be that way."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Unless you want to. I ain't stopping you there.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Yeah, but I don't. It's tiring and I don't feel good."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you want, you can try to stay quiet. You were pretty intimidating when you did that."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I see.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you have another drink or did you have too many already?
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I can handle another one. Get me a Fringe Weaver.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Yup, that's the one. Thanks."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,...
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Is this punishment for trying to look tough?
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh? Maybe... I guess.
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,This isn't my order.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Do I need to actually be a tough guy to get the right drink?
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Say, that guy over there."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil? What's up with him?
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Are you dating him?
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Is he seeing anyone?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not as far as I know.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Do you think he...
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He...?
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"No, nevermind! I said nothing."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Thank you for everything.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Gil. You heartbreaking fuckboy."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Eh? What?
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nothing.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, Mario. You really like bikes, huh?"
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"I guess, yeah."
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Whenever I got into a car, I always felt like I was in some sort of cage."
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"With a motorcycle, I can feel the wind and everything on my face first."
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"It's... liberating, you know?"
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Besides, I get motion sickness in cars only for some reason."
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Motion sickness is something I've always found interesting.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Why?
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, you get dizzy when too many movements are happening at once. And then the body gets that signal and throws up."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But you throw up because your body thinks the dizziness is due to eating something bad.
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We take it for granted, but humans were not made to fly or move that fast."
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Motion sickness is a bug of sorts.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,Bug?
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like the ones in computers.
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,I have no idea what you're talking about.
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mario,"Alright then, I'll be leaving now. Thank you for everything."
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Please, come again."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"He didn't look like a ""Mario"" to me."
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Same.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll be taking my break now, Gil."
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Okay. Careful.
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, back to business."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Back.
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any luck?
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I managed to give out some flyers, but most people were distracted by the dog."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I had to tell them to go to the Rad Shiba Bar to get their attention.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, I'm back to my office.YOU stay here."
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Fiiiiiiiiine.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"The door opens, and the crowd goes wild when they see AAAAAAAAAAGH! DOOOOOOOOOG!"
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,'sup little girl? What are you doing in a bar?
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,H-H-Honey... some help here.
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey dog, I heard cats in the alley."
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Really?! I'll check them out!
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wow. You really are bad with dogs, eh?"
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did I make it too obvious?
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why though?
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I don't know.
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, hey John!"
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hey.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I think it's because I just got that trait at random.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"When AIs are created, they're given fears or tastes completely at random."
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I just happened to get stuck with a fear of dogs and chinchillas.
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Chinchillas are extinct, though."
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thank gods.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What will you have?
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, it's that time of the month, so I'll have a Bleeding Jane."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right... um... up.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""That time of the month""... do Lilim menstruate?"
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yes, oil."
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"No, silly. We don't."
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"There are a few maintenance things we have to do every month, but those are a different story."
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then what time of the month is it?
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The time when I feel like drinking a Bleeding Jane.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Ah, honey... I can't get angry at you for messing up my order with this."
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Your paycheck will be the one to suffer, but I'm not angry."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,This isn't Jane and she isn't bleeding.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Do you really want me to get violent and find the drink by myself, honey?"
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Nah, just kidding, but be careful with my drinks."
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how's business?"
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You'd be surprised by how many people get struck by holiday depression and need some Dorothy in their lives.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Although it's also the season with the most competition.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I didn't know you had competition.
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Of course I do, both humans and Lilim. Half of them got a sexy Santa dress and that's not fair!"
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They were sold out! I wanted one too!
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But maybe it's better that way.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The other girls like to dress in skimpy clothes and show lots of skin. That scares off lots of people.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I learned that the best way to maintain regulars is to just dress normally.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If I dress normally, they can just pretend I'm some acquaintance. No need to hide me until reaching the room."
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hell, some even invite me to a dinner or a movie before anything else."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Although I must say it's a bit hard to get the clients in the first place. They can't tell what I do at a glance.
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And the first time they see me after a call they think I'm just making a prank or something.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, I never saw it that way."
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Which reminds me. Do you serve only humans or do you serve Lilim too?
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Humans only, but I do have an ""at least 40% organic"" policy."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,40%?
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Human from the neck up. Dicks preferably organic, but I can make exceptions."
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"For females, I'm not so strict though."
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why? Do you know someone that might be interested?
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, just mere curiosity."
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, your curiosity left me thirsty. Get me a Blue Fairy. A big one, would you?"
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I wonder if anyone has seen fairies after a couple of these.
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some guy tested that by drinking as many as he could.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He thought he saw one, but he was dizzy and what he'd seen was his puke."
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, you know how they say that size doesn't matter?"
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It doesn't, but in this case it does."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The lack of blue in this drink is making me feel blue.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm pink, honey. Why would you make me feel blue?"
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Strike two! Focus more, honey!"
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know, earlier today there was a Mega Christmas spirit around here."
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What about it?
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(That I'm realizing I made a fuss about serving drinks to someone underaged, but here I am.)"
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nothing in particular, just a funny story."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I have a funny story myself. It's the Mega Santa prank!
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* The what?
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Heh. It's a prank I pull every year.
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"First, I pick a mall, wait for a day with lots of people."
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Then I go to Santa's lap, and when he asks what I want..."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I say in the most innocent tone I can muster...
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""I want you to make me a woman!"""
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Sometimes they try to cover it up. ""The Lilim wants to be human!"""
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's then when I say, ""No, I. Want. You."""
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"After that I say: ""Well, at the very least I want a dildo, a big pink one. Or a very bumpy cucumber!"""
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sometimes I spice it up. Instead of cucumbers I ask for a pony and a crane to lift him.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I once thought about screaming, ""Help! I'm being molested!"""
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But I remembered it was a prank, I didn't want to ruin the guy's life."
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How considerate.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Although I did get a client that way. He became a regular soon after.
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But yeah, three years and they still don't get that it's always me."
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, how old are you?"
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Old enough for anything you want.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Numbers. I need numbers.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Are you really asking a girl her age that way? Okay then, tell me your age first."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,27.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,No fair! You didn't get fidgety or anything like that.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Fiiiine. I'll tell you.
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,My model's designed to look between 10 to 13 years old. But my last checkup said my mental age was 24.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How long since you've been deployed?
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That's a secret I'll keep with me~
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fair enough.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I expected you to get all uncomfortable talking about your age though. Why didn't you?
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"With how dangerous everything's been lately, every year you get matters."
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Getting old isn't a curse, it's an achievement."
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You should make a shirt with that. Because if you don't, I will."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Feel free to do so.
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want anything else?
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's see...
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh! A Cobalt Velvet. It's been a while since I've tried one of those.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cobalt Velvet.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yup, this is the one."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you like it?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I don't dislike it. I guess I'm not mature enough for these drinks.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Fiiiiiiiiine, I'll let this one pass."
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, honey, honey... why do you do this to me? At least pretend to try."
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hey honey. Have you ever seen a Mega Santa gangbang?
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Meg-... eh?
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That Mega Santa that became a regular of mine. He once invited like 8 of his friends.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Gangbangs are funny because with that many guys, no one knows what to do."
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"They think about using you too, but they don't wanna touch the other guys."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, you should've thought about that before getting naked in front of other guys!"
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Eight guys, and in the end, only two got into it while the others left."
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Even my regular left!
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll regret asking this, but were all the other guys...?"
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup! They were Mega Santas that worked with him.
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course they were...
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I've been in many, but I still don't get the charm of gangbangs. Orgies I can see though."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, either remembering that got me turned on or the alcohol is kicking in."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Either way, I'm leaving. Bye, honey!"
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That girl has seen some shit.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Now I can't see Mega Santas with the same eyes.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, honey. What day's today?"
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wednesday.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"No, the number. The number!"
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Number? 21.
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shouldn't you know that?
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm a Lilim, not a calendar."
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I thought you would know that much.
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Next you're gonna tell me to make some convoluted calculation.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-You can't?
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I could if I put my mind to it, but it's not something I have quick access to."
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yes, I have an inner calendar and a calculator, but those are used in lots of other operations every second."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I COULD do all that, but it's a lot quicker to just ask you."
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do you need the date though?
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I have something to do on the 26th... I've been avoiding it for a while now.
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh! But don't worry, it's nothing dangerous or anything like that, just... heavy."
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Would you like some help?
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Would you help me?
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If you tell me what it is you need help with.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...maybe later. I have to go now.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,See ya later!
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bye.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Do you think she really can't access calendars and calculators that easily?
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I guess it's kinda like how even if a text processor can access the computer's calendar, you don't use it for that."
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Why didn't you tell her you missed her yesterday?
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Forgot about it.
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I didn't find any cats.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why not look again?
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Good idea!
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh? Another kid?
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Maybe the bar got popular at some middle school?
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That would be a hassle.
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh gods, maybe Alma was right."
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Right about what?
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, the other day I was asking her her opinion on the whole Alice_Rabbit thing."
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Before the whole massive transmission hack thing.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And at some point she talked about hacking becoming a fad and said:
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Imagine if, suddenly, a group of tweens broke into this bar and started asking for drinks."""
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And today, there have been two kids already."
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eeeeeh...
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,How would bartending become a fad?
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe a cartoon?
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Kids' cartoons don't show any alcohol.
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,True.
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Excuse me, Miss..."
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is no place for kids, so you should..."
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, she's staring too much. And she's saying nothing."
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"She's not ordering anything, she's not causing trouble and there's nothing inappropriate here."
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I mean, nothing inappropriate aside from alcohol. But alcohol is everywhere anyways."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So what do you suggest?
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let her be? Maybe she's just curious about the bar.
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's saying nothing.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Maybe she's curious AND shy.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Also, it's rude to speak about people you have in front of you like they can't hear you."
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah...
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Jill.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,BWAH!
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,How the hell did I startle you?
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you want?
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Can you help me out here with a Beer?
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Thanks. And lower your guard a bit, please."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Um... right.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Could you relax? It's just a girl.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh yeah, before I forget."
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,The disposal unit comes on Sunday. Do you have any expired ingredients on your side?
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh right. Yeah.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's a bottle of Karmotrine that's like a month past expiration.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Put it by the sink so I remember to dispose of it.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"Hey, Miss."
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...!
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yes?
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Are you happy?
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Am I happy? Well... that's a weird question.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not sad, I guess. I'm not jubilant, but..."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"No, I mean, are you happy with your life? With your choices?"
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Deep question...
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, I might have one or two regrets but I guess it could be worse."
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Regrets?
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I mean... don't we all?"
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,I see...
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hey Jill.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,BWAH!
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...again? Aren't you a bit on edge?
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe. What did you want?
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Didn't you borrow the screwdriver the other day?
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I did, why?"
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I forgot to take the coins from the arcades in the corner last week.
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So I need it to take them out.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, let's see..."
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not like they see much action these days anyways.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Chump change is still money. Pocket change has saved my ass many times.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What? Did you throw it in someone's face while escaping?
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That only happened once and the old lady started it!
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...right.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Why does an arcade still use coins nowadays? Or physical money, when you get down to it."
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,For the reason arcades still exist. Nostalgia.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"Hey, Miss."
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Eh? Yeah?
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Do you recognize me?
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Recognize you?
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...I want to say I do, but... eh..."
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Really? You can't remember your own sister's face?
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sister? Sorry, but I don't have any sis-..."
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sister?
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"Not even a ""sister in law""?"
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...no way. Gaby? Is that really you?
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"God, I'm so sorry, but you've just grown so much since I last saw you."
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How long has it been?
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...three years.
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right.
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So you know her?
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. She's actually my girlfr-... my ex's sister.
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Um... so, how have you been doing?"
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"I actually had to transfer schools, and I managed to skip a grade thanks to the admission tests."
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,I'll be out of middle school next year.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You've always been a smart one, so it's no surprise."
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you thought about what you want to study in college? You always said you wanted to be a scientist.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,I don't know yet. I guess I still have a couple of years to think about that.
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, don't feel pressured about that. Maybe you'll need a sabbatical year?"
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-So... how's Lenore?
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Wait, who's Lenore?"
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Her sister, she's... um... she was my girlfriend."
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So you actually had a relationship with something that's not a cat? Color me surprised!
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hey... don't talk shit about my baby.
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how's Lenore doing?"
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,She's dead.
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, I don't think I heard right."
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"My sister is dead, Jill. She died last Saturday. I came all the way to tell you the news."
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Come on Gaby, stop fooling arou-..."
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"No, YOU stop fooling around, I mean, WOW!"
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"My sister was left to suffer her disease alone while you were all merry here, mixing drinks and chatting!"
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, Lenore was sick? Of what? Since when?"
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Localized Nanomachine Rejection. It gave her a heart attack.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,She started complaining about chest pains not long after you left.
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"Was all the talk about getting your freedom worth it, Jill?"
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Was your right to be merry worth the life of my sister?!
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why are you lashing out at me like that?! Did I infect her with the disease that killed her?
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"No, but. It's too much of a coincidence that she started getting worse and worse right after you left!"
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,She got visibly sick after your fight. It'd be no surprise if that fight played a key role in killing her!
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But that's just speculation, you can't expect-..."
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"And all of that because you wanted ""freedom""?!"
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,What kind of freedom is so enticing that it makes you hurt a nice three-year-old relationship?!
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Was this freedom so important you cut all contact with us?!
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Was this freedom so good you left everything behind?!
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Was this freedom worth the life of my-...
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,SHUT UP!
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I didn't kill your sister, for fuck's sake! It's not like I infected her with that Nanomachine Rejection!"
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hell, this is the first time I've even heard she was sick!"
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And do you really know what kind of fear drove me to have that argument with your sister?!
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you even understand the fear of feeling your youth slip through your fingers?!
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you think it was all easy for me?! I was scared! I'm still scared! But I needed to grab a hold of my life!
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But it has nothing to do with your sister!
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I loved her... Do you think that fight didn't hurt me too?
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I...
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,...idiot.
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... I...
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'll make sure that girl gets to wherever she wants to go safely.
