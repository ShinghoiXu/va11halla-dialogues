2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is good, really good."
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You have no idea how long I've wanted some curry.
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I remember I meant to eat some, but then I had to pay for some drinks I spilled on the floor."
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That screwed up my budget.
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's the least I can do after being such an obnoxious client.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, about that. Mind if I ask something? Mister... Timothy Mercury."
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,So you know?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a small city. Turns out two very grateful girls soon became regulars and both of them were related to you.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"So what's your question, Bartender?"
11,undefined,undefined,dialogues,Jill,Call me Jill.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Two questions, actually."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The first one is, why did they brand you as a traitor? Because you killed the other guy?"
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know. It sounds weird considering the other guy assaulted two little girls.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It was a cover up.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,The guy was my superior.
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"A high-ranking officer like him, assaulting innocent civilians? That would be unthinkable... on paper at least."
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"On record, I hurt the girls and killed him before another unit subdued me, then I escaped from their custody."
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,In reality...
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's all I needed to know. Sorry for bringing that up.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Didn't you have another question?
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. How did you build this restaurant so fast?
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's a small city. Turns out two very grateful girls tracked me down to thank me.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,One of them was rich and the other noticed I smelled like curry.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Heh... those two are really nice girls, huh?"
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,They didn't deserve what that bastard did to them.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Excuse me...
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Oh, speaking of the angels."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Timmy! Two special curries, please."
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh, hi Jill!"
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Oh god! I can't believe I'm actually here! The concert will begin any second now!
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wow, I've never seen her so openly excited before."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Don't talk too loudly or you'll startle her.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It's always nice to see her so happy she doesn't give a damn and lets herself go.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You sure you don't mind me?
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Of course not! That way I won't be the only one with little clue as to what's going on!
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Is it true that you've served this *Kira* Miki girl at the bar?
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,As amazing as it sounds.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really nice girl... If a bit oblivious to the risk some people represent.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,How so?
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She doesn't mind stalkers and such.
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Oh.
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How's your wounds?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Arm's doing fine, eye's healing nicely, and I can sleep better at night."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just what transpired inside that bank?
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It's not important anymore.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,What's important is that Stella will get me a job after I heal!
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She will?
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She's rebuilding a new armor set for me and wants me to be her bodyguard.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'd be paid for something I do anyways and I'll get to spend more time with her!
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's nice.
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'd like to spread out and help more people, but it's a nice start."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You want to be a vigilante, then?"
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Maybe.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,KYAAAAAAAH!! SHE'S COMING OUT! IT'S HER! IT'S ACTUALLY HER!
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Look, it started."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Are you here, Jill? This song is for you!"
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what?
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So yeah, the guy had a fantasy about a woman castrating him."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I tried for an hour to convince him it's a bad idea, and I finally got to him."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"We finally move to the bedroom, and it turns out the guy has a weird implant where his testicles should be."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It's basically a removable ball sack!
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I suppose the guy really liked that fantasy and made sure he could live it out properly.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I once saw a guy at the hospital in the emergency room, after having been castrated to fulfill a fantasy."
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I wonder if it's the same guy.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I have enough problems with just one, you know?"
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Just one what?
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh... um...
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Heheh...
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,With just listening to one of your anecdotes.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You told me about the Neo-Tijuana thing, and now this. Don't you have a more... subdued story?"
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Come on Jo, you're an adult. You can take that much."
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shut up.)
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Well...
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Last time I spoke with my mom, I asked her the story of her daughter. Turns out her name was Anna."
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And now you pretend it's a surprise?
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Quiet you.)
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She fought against Nanomachine Rejection for most of her life.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She even lost a girlfriend she made in the hospital to that same sickness.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Apparently sometime after she got out of treatment, a truck hit her and killed her."
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But even then, she was amazing!"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She was?
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Eh?
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yeah! She kept up her studies while still in the hospital! She was a self-taught honor student!
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Not only that, but she also ranked among the top five candidates in at least three college admission exams!"
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She also played the piano and guitar!
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, being confined to a room does that, I guess."
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I mean, fully able-bodied people can barely do half of that..."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But she practically accomplished all that by herself!
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And she also beat Nanomachine Rejection! A disease that only 2% of humans suffer, and even less survive."
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It took a trucking truck to take her down. She was great! And to think I'm sort of like her sister...
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Heh... silly Becky.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, did you say something?"
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...!
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm? I did not.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Weird, I swear I heard somebody call me ""Silly Becky""."
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...!
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Come again?
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's not uncommon for me to hear stuff from far away and think I've heard it nearby, but..."
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You're the only one nearby that knows my real name, so it was weird."
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh well. As I was saying, the ballsack guy..."
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I can't believe you actually made me do that sleepover thing.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You didn't have to accept, you know?"
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up...
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,I'm having a good time!
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,See? Even Gaby is having fun. Relax a bit!
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, whatever."
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"You know, Alma. You remind me a bit of my sis."
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I do? How?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,You always manage to get a reaction from Jill.
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Sis always said that Jill acknowledging your presence is the best way to know she likes you.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're talking too much, Gaby."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Aww...
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"It's different with you, though."
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"With my sis, Jill was more... frustrated."
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,Like this one time where she bought her a shirt that...
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're talking too much, little girl."
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A shirt that what?
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,That had a pic of a cucumber on it!
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Cucumber?
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,U-Um... OW! Just what are you doing with my hair?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sorry, it got stuck in one of my fingers."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seriously...
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So I'm a bit like Lenore then?
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"N-No, you just remind me of her a bit."
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,"Moreover, my sister wasn't as... um... as..."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,As...?
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ass. What this girl is trying to say is that with your tits and ass, you could build a Lenore and a half out of the mass."
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That just means there's enough to share with both of you.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gaby,S-Share?!
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you're talking too much, Alma."
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I guess this is where we part ways, huh?"
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Sadly, I'm bound to this city. I can only falsify my identity effectively around here."
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I really want to thank you, Chief, for this second chance you gave me."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"If we ever cross paths again, I-..."
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Gil, we're leaving for like, a week and a half or something. Don't be so dramatic."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,But I...
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,AND you're taking care of my apartment. We WILL cross paths because I live there.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The time you spend setting up a useless farewell could be used asking me things about the place.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Like where the switches and valves are.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,But I already know. They're in that control panel you made.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,But I like talking about that control panel. I'm proud of it.
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Speaking of obsessive likes...
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Jill! Stop calling Armitage! She'll take care of your Fore Ball just fine.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not worried about him, I'm worried about me!"
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've never been away from Fore this long. I don't what I'll do!
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You'll do just fine. You did pretty well for at least 25 years before finding him.
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yes, but..."
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,WE'RE LEAVING!
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh yeah, before I forget."
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I left you a box of condoms on the first drawer of the desk, Gil."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You what?!
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You what?
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey, if he wants to bring his new girlfriend or whatever here, I want him to be ready!"
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, but just one condition. If you're gonna fuck like rabbits, stay away from my room."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I have too many pics of my imouto there and I don't want their eyes soiled.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Imowho?
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Little sister.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then just say little sister.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yeah, whatever."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"First stop, Panama!"
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sigh. To think I'd be evicted...
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They are pretty ruthless. They don't even allow you to skip one month?
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I... was two months late already, actually."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"*sigh* Jill, Jill..."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"At least it wasn't because you spent too much money on useless stuff, right?"
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...right?
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About that...
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Forget it. I don't wanna hear.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's go to sleep. Tomorrow you'll regroup and think what to do next.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah...
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks for letting me stay here by the -- WHOA! Your bed is huge!
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A Queen size. Considering I lived with a guy for at least four years...
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It can get lonely, but also really comfortable. Just like single life I guess."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hope you don't mind sleeping with me, but there's not enough space for the futon in here."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I haven't slept in a mattress in... fuck, over two years now."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That can be good for your back.
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And bad for my morale.
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, good night."
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nighty night.
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,None,...
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It's hot in here.)
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Having her hug me certainly doesn't help.)
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I don't wanna wake her up either, she looks so comfortable right now.)"
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder if Boss would've let me crash in her place.)
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Oh well, let's just try to sleep a bit and...)"
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Fore,...
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(No Fore, go away.)"
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(No, you piece of fur don't you dare sleep on my fa-...)"
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,MMMMPH.
