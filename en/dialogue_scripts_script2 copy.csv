2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hey Jill...
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,BWAH!!
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's a sound you don't hear every day.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,B-Boss? What are you doing with that helmet?
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I was just about to ask you where it came from.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A White Knight came yesterday. She left and... well... she forgot to take it with her.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I figured she'd eventually come looking for it so I left it under the count-... wait.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you regularly put things on without asking who they belong to first?
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I don't plan and evaluate every move, Jill... I just act."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, as your boss, I'm taking this helmet until the client comes for it."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You sound happy.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, this helmet is comfortable. And cool. And comfortable, and cool, and... and really, really cool."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,'ello...
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"It's strange that you're late, Gil."
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yeah, the traffic was... GAH!"
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Don't run! You have work to do!
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'M NOT GOING BACK TO HONG KONG!!!
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hong Kong?
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,C-Chief?
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"S-Sorry, I thought you were someone else."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Apparently.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll leave the rest up to you. I'll detonate the Pluto Warhead somewhere safe.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The what where now?
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Nothing. Nevermind.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,She seems happy.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's been tense these past couple of days. If she's somehow relaxed now, good."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you all set?
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yup.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and cha-...
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, Miss Kim."
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Because of you I got up late and lost a full day of work! And on the day everyone got a nifty assignment too!
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wait. Because of me?
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,You were the one that got me drunk and made me fall asleep like a goddamn log!
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you arrived home safely. That's nice.
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,T-That's all you have to say?!
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you want me to say?
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If I felt remorse over every client that gets drunk in here, I wouldn't be working."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,B-But...!
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"True. Morally speaking, I shouldn't let people get drunk."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But getting people drunk IS the unspoken main purpose of my job.
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And I did say that I didn't know how much alcohol you could handle, didn't I?"
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I... AGH!
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Seriously, what kind of answer is THAT?!"
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Ugh... Hello Mr. Donovan.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Do I know you?
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey, brat. You're in luck! I decided to bless this place again."
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Luck he says...)
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, Mr. Donovan. Welcome to Valhalla. What can I get you?"
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"What do you think I want, kid?"
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Close. Partial credit.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yes. Now, that's what I call service!"
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's good to hear.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(He wanted his fucking Beer! How could I mess this one up?!)
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,H-Here...
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I'll take it, but there's no credit for trying."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Aaaand, wrong. Sorry, kid. Better luck next time."
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(At least he didn't ask me to redo it.)
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What brings you here today, Mr. Donovan?"
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Today, we were supposed to hand the interns an article topic."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,All those crazy bitches came flocking to me like the first high schooler with a car.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I couldn't deal with it, so I switched places with some poor sap."
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"He was supposed to be doing an interview today, but to hell with that."
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And thanks to all that shit, I found myself here, blessing your hell hole with my presence."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You were here yesterday too. How did that come about?
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,There's this gal that's performing at a concert later tonight.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yesterday, I was tuning the details of the interview I'd have with her today."
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And like I said, I'd rather work here than deal with a pack of competitive bitches."
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How was the interview?
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Easy enough. The fact that the gal had a nice pair of knockers helped.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"We've come a long way in the department of Lilim sex appeal, I tell you."
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She was a Lilim then?
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yes, one of those new fancy King-Class CH1A models."
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I've heard they're anatomically correct in every way.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I wouldn't mind finding out about that myself.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hm? Hey, you! The guy with a John face."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Huh? Me?
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"What the hell is a ""John Face?"""
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, you. Do I know you?"
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I don't think so, sir."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"No, no. I'm pretty sure I know you."
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Wait wait wait... it was the Hong Kong riots ten years ago, right?"
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I-I've never been to Hong Kong... and I certainly didn't defect from any anti-riot force after stealing supplies.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Really? That's a bummer.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You look like a guy who owes me a drink.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You were in those riots, Mr. Donovan?"
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Do I look like some anarchist hippie to you?
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Ten years ago, I tried to start a silicone business."
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So, I was in Hong Kong talking with some investors when those damned riots broke out."
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Seriously, though. Did they really think the laws they were trying to pass wouldn't backfire?"
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They were openly trying to segregate people with augmentations!
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"No matter how many ""They have different capabilities"" you put in-between, it's still segregation."
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And once people start crying ""Segregation!"" like that you're doomed."
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"This is the PR century! If you're gonna do that, disguise it a bit."
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a... very laconic way of summarizing the incident.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, there was a political agenda revolving around cheap labour."
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And the plan reached such a developed stage because the media was instilling fear in the public.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The general fear that augmented people would become power-hungry maniacs was a key factor in the plans.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And everything is mostly the aftermath of previous protests where-...
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"On second thought, maybe it's better to be laconic."
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Trying to get the full picture might take you back beyond the industrial revolution.
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,All that happened when I got out of high school.
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I remember I had to turn down a scholarship in Hong Kong because of all that.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Heh, scholarship. That's no mean feat, brat."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I guess even without the scholarship, there would have been the language barrier."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I remember I was kinda excited back then because I was really into this one Chinese idol band.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's... one of those things I'd rather not remember much of.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You'd be surprised at how easy Chinese can be.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you know how to speak Chinese?
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,The only translator I had available was some pizza-faced pencilneck.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And I wasn't gonna allow myself to be seen with THAT.
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"If someone like me can learn Chinese in two weeks, well..."
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm guessing a scholarship student might have a chance.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Why do I feel like he suddenly challenged me to finally learn Chinese?)
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Chinese?)
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait... when you say ""Chinese"", do you mean Mandarin or Cantonese?"
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Tangerine? Cantowhat?
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When people say ""Chinese,"" they're usually referring to the written word. Not the spoken one."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's important to clarify because there are lots of dialects in the Chinese language.
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In Hong Kong, lots of people speak Cantonese, so just saying ""Chinese"" won't do."
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You might've learned Cantonese because you were only going to Hong Kong.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Or you might've learned Mandarin because it's the one spoken by the majority elsewhere...
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I went to Hong Kong and managed to seal a deal. I have no idea about anything else.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Anyways, surely a student with a scholarship can serve me a Marsblast too, right?"
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*ahem* S-Sure, on it."
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Alright. I guess I'll believe your story.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Right...)
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,This is good! But wrong. Like having sex with your business partner's wife.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Suuuuuuuuure, a scholarship. Hong Kong must have very low standards."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey kid, I got wasted yesterday, so there's certain protocol here."
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Would you mind telling me if I said anything someone could use against me in a court of law?
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Unless complaining about your investors can be used as a legal weapon, I don't think so."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh, good. Fuck those sons of bitches."
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,What did I tell you?
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"How they wanted unreasonable stuff, how they feel like they have more power than you do, and all that."
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh yeah, I recall something like that. But then again, it seems to be something I say a lot when drunk."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,That and racial slurs in German.
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Racial slurs in... what?)
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But let me tell you something. There are people worse than your investors.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Your clients.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Excuse me?
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Your readers! If you think clients are always right then you're wrong -- unless I'm the client, that is."
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,We live in an era where PR is the first and only word in anything.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You can sell the shittiest of stuff and people will buy it if you're the apple of their eyes.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But make one fucking mistake and it's OVER for you. You're suddenly a criminal to them.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,No chance of appeal. Gods forbid if they ever catch something you said out of context.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"A month ago, we had to clarify that we were talking about the animal in an article about ""cougars in nearby forests."""
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,All because we got a pack of forty-year-old divorced soccer moms crying about hurt feelings.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They were having picnic parties in the same forests and thought we were writing about them.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,God! I hope at least one of them gets eaten by their damned namesake.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pfft...
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, it's funny when somebody else hears it, but the smell of rosy perfume still makes my blood boil."
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Nowadays, nobody can take a joke. They're always out for blood."
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You can't win. You will ALWAYS offend somebody.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And while some take it graciously, many just LOVE feeling insulted."
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They RELISH the thought of ganging up against something.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And those hypersensitive bastards are your clients - they're the ones you have to target.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I run a goddamn newspaper! The whole point is to present news in the most neutral way possible!
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Being offended by a newspaper is like being angry at the mirror.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Sure... let's go with that.)
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I mean, it's not like he's totally wrong, but...)"
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Hearing it from him is kinda...)
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, I'm a bit interested in this interview you had. Can you tell me anything about it?"
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You don't run any blogs, right? No microphones hiding between your boobs?"
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,...do you have boobs at all?
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...*cough*
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's this one blog I wrote when I was 12. But it just fills me with shame, so I try to forget it exists."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Okay then.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,It started with the same boring questions.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"How are you, why choose this place, how's the city, the tour, new single, blah blah blah..."
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"It went by very quickly. It was the ""Regular Interview Stencil,"" as we call it in the business."
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,So I tried some fun questions afterwards.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"""How big are your tits? Is it true that you don't wear underwear on stage? Are you still a virgin?"""
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did she react?
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,She answered them like it was the most natural thing on earth!
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I don't think I wanna know what kind of questions other people have asked.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I did it to get a reaction out of her, but she just took it in her stride."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"In case you were interested, the answers were: 91 centimeters, depends on the costume, and no."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Her room backstage was filled to the brim with gifts of all sorts.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Dolls, blue roses, chocolates, fruit. I'm pretty sure I saw at least three dildos in there too."
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thanks for the info, I guess."
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Perhaps too much info, but thanks anyways."
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You're lucky I'm in a good mood.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Damn, look at the time, I need to get back to work soon."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I just finished an interview and it must be posted as soon as possible.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,The fact that we're posting it AFTER the chick finished her concert is enough of a problem already.
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something delayed the interview?
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,The interview was supposed to happen last Friday!
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"One of the interns -- this meek little girl -- was supposed to do it, but for some fucking reason, she just didn't."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I spent two days negotiating something else instead.
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Negotiating""... did you have to pay or something?"
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Basically, when that encore concert happens, I need to plaster that chick's face all over the front page."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Okay then. One last drink before I leave.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Give me something bitter to wake me up.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, this works just fine."
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is this fine?
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"No, I'm gonna doze off with this shit, kid."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You know, I feel like I should compensate the poor bastard that took the heat today."
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh?
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah. That kid, Joel... Jean... Guillermo... Hirohito... I can't remember his name."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,That kid is always gushing about that idol I interviewed.
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I can't remember anyone for shit, but he's annoying enough to make me remember him."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So, I dunno. I feel like I cockblocked 'im big time today by taking his gig away."
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Worst of all, I left him to fend off a pack of crazy bitches."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And that's something I wouldn't wish on anyone, not even my worst enemies... well... maybe two of 'em."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're sounding so considerate right now.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I'm no saint, kid, but I'm a man."
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And a man must never cockblock another man unless he's trying to fuck your mom.
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What if it's your dad?
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Did. I. Stutter?
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you can get him tickets or something.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Nah, see. That'd mean he'd be off work. And I need him to be at my beck and call tonight."
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I've seen that brat talk to no end about her, so..."
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I know! I'll let him write about her somewhere else in the newspaper.
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Give him the Food Critic's column. It's shit anyways.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Heheh... I'm so fucking nice.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I'm out, kid."
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank you, please come again."
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(That'd be something interesting to see, I guess.)"
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Man, that gal's producer was angry as fuck. Trying to negotiate with him was a hassle."
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I've had less problems dealing with SoCal Justice Warriors.
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"SoCal Justice Warriors, that mafia/vigilante group that runs around solving crimes in swimsuits."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, those artificially blond, artificially tanned folks with big blunt objects. Yeah."
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"They're an interesting group, you know?"
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They only accept people born or raised in South California and go through hellish training on a daily basis.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They have to. No normal person can run around in swimsuits in this cold weather.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"They have an interesting view on the world and how it works, but they're pretty sensitive too."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Too many outlets have insulted them in the past, so they are trigger-happy against defamation."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I've had a dozen guys in speedos talking to me about some news while flaunting their bags of batteries.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And they were still more polite than that producer guy.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Think about it. Watching a banana hammock move at the same time as a bag of batteries was more pleasant.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm pretty sure there's a ""banana hammocks and bags of batteries"" audience somewhere, though."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Well, I'm out."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank you, please come again."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, yeah..."
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That was... um... tiring.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey Jill, I think I have a problem."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...don't tell me.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yup. I can't take the helmet off.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yeah, yeah. Very funny."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you check the internet for help?
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"""How to take off a Valkyrie-type White Knight Helmet"" is not precisely a common query, you know?"
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I could break it, but I don't wanna damage a client's propert-..."
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,W-What? Did you run out of air?!
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I just realized you served a Valkyrie in Valhalla.
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,HAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shit... d-don't scare me like that.
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I don't think you can run out of air with this helmet.
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you gonna do?
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I know someone that might help me. I'll give her a call.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Let's see... where was her number... oh! Here it is.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey, Iris! I need some unclogging advice."
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Iris?
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I've heard Chief call her a couple of times. Maybe she's a friend?
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"More importantly, will Chief be fine?"
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She will. Even if there's no God or Buddha, you can always trust Boss."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yeah... let's hope you're right.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, honey! Can you see me?"
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Dorothy."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I can see you. Why?"
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really? Man! Did they sell me the wrong stuff?
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who sold you what?
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Jill, I'm going out for a bit to buy a screwdriver and bacon and..."
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...are you talking to yourself again?
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I'm not."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hello!
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, hello Dorothy... wherever you are."
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll be back in a bit then.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She didn't see you?
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh! I get it now.
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They sold me a VIC Jammer. Not an optic camouflage system.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... care to explain?
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Have you seen those pics or videos of someone stripping or undressing?
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But I mean the ones where the clothes are the only thing you see and the other person is invisible.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...come again?
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,There's people out there with a fetish for invisible people.
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Where you can only see a few articles of clothes floating about.
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I was trying to find something that would let me cater to that fetish, but my contact misunderstood my request."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I asked him to bring me something that'd make me invisible. And he did.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But I'm only invisible to cameras.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Even then, wouldn't your clothes be invisible too with such a jammer or something?"
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hm... you have a point.
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh well. I'll work something out. Maybe I'll get a Nanocamo module.
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nanocamo?
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Haven't you heard of Nanocamo?
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They're a military technology company that recently branched to civilian appliances.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They use nanotechnology to make fabric or other materials take any color or texture you want.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You can order a module from them and change the colors of clothes, walls or tables with it!"
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm... sounds interesting. Maybe I'll look it up.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What does that have to do with what you want though?
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If I remember correctly, they have a module that makes things almost invisible to the human eye."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It was quite pricey last I checked though.
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Almost""? ""To the human eye""?"
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, it's not perfect, if you move you'd be an eerie, surroundings-colored blob."
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And we Lilim see things differently, so it's ineffective against us."
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Still, it might be what I need..."
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Now, what was that about talking to yourself ""again""?"
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nothing important.
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you having?
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm in a good mood, so give me a Piano Woman."
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One Piano Woman.
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Thanks! I love these ones, you know?"
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I keep them for special occasions - whenever I'm feeling good or when I need to get out of a slump.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And today?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Today I feel good.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's nice.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hm...
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"As much as I enjoy the company of men, this isn't my kind of drink."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I don't like drinks that aren't sweet.
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I deal with enough bitterness at work.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll keep it in mind.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(What does she mean by bitter-... wait, no. Don't wanna know.)"
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here...
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hm...
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hmhmhm...
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Wrong drink, but I can't say no to one of these. Lucky you."
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Buzz! Wrong!
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Don't worry. I still love you.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's... nice to know.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Okay, then. How's this for a bonus payment?"
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... the ticket from Friday.
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Can't believe I still remember that.)
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That guy was so nice in giving it to me.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...too bad it was filled to the brim with dogs. I would've enjoyed the drink here otherwise.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I don't think this ticket should be valid...)
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(...but then again, they were improvised, so there isn't really a contract involved or anything.)"
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You know...
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If you're lonely enough to start talking to yourself, we could hit an arrangement."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Keep me fed and I'll keep you company.
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You'll still need to pay if you want to get naughty, though."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think I'll pass. I already have a cat that does all that.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you pay him to-...
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Finish that sentence and I'll make sure you truly become invisible.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine. Consider this a standing offer, though."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh! Hey John!
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah, Dorothy."
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Didn't see you here last Friday.
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I was... dealing with some stuff over the weekend.
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,AND Monday.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yeah, yeah..."
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Was it a girl?
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I wish...
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What did you do? What did you do?
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'd rather not talk about it.
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey honey, what did he do?"
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil's been a complete mystery for as long as I've known him.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,His past is like a nebulous mass that tries to bite him every once in a while.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nebulous?
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You hear so much random stuff it's hard to make connections about what happened when.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And, you know, people lie."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Does your boss know about it?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She said ""I'm not one to judge"". Seems like she knows what the hell's going on."
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But I think I'm better off not knowing. It's not really that necessary and it's a pain to think about.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I'm... right here, you know?"
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did I tell any lies?
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"No, but..."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...nevermind.
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh yeah. About your boss. Why was she wearing a helmet?
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She found it. She put it on. Now, she's stuck."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh. Yeah, randomly putting on stuff you find is problematic."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No shit.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I mean, there's this girl that wanted to see if she could use a glass bottle as a-..."
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*ahem* A bit early for those stories, don't you think?"
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nope.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"By the way, it's weird that I didn't see you yesterday."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I have a job too, you know?"
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but you usually come before you start."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Aww... did you miss me that much?
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yesterday was a bit different. I worked the entire day.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know if I should ask.
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, it was weird, but not... kinky weird?"
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The guy paid me to spend ALL DAY pretending to be his daughter.
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yeah, I go to his house at 11 a.m, dress as requested and spend all day there."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Play some games, occasionally tell him I love him, go to bed when ordered, and leave."
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nothing sexual. I used to expect him to push me against the ground and have his way with me.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But after three years, it's unlikely that'll happen."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Three years?
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yeah. One day a year for three years now.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, but last year he also wanted me to play the part on his daughter's birthday."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wait a second... does he have a daughter or not?
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Had. Seems she died four years ago.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup. I seem to attract that kind of people for some reason.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of people?
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nobody. I said nothing.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Gimme a Moonblast, would you?"
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,There's something interesting about this drink.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I don't actually like it, but I can't stop drinking them."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It tastes like a bit of sugar drowned in pure alcohol. Small wonder you feel like that.
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Alright, I'll take your offer this time."
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'll let you know I don't do this with everyone.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here yo-...
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And you're WRONG.
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If I remember correctly, you have a recipe book. Mind using it?"
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, did you see something about a concert outside?"
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,A concert?
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yeah. Now that you mention it, I remember seeing a line near the stadium a couple of blocks away."
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"They couldn't take their eyes off of me, so I took some photos with them."
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why do you ask?
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Someone was here just a minute ago. Seems he was interviewing the star of the show.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really? What kind of person is this star?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some girl. He didn't tell me her name.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems she's a King-Class CH1A.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh...
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's with that reaction?
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Nothing, it's just that the CH1A is the model that comes after mine."
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yeah, they think they're so important because they have more sensitivity points in their skins."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And because their voice modulators are more advanced.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They do?
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"...n-no, I'm just kinda jealous that they do."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I had to mod myself to have what they have from the get-go, you know?"
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, they don't make DFC-72s like you anymore?"
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"My line is quite alive and well, thank you very much."
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The difference with the CH1A is mostly that they sacrifice functionality for appearance.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They don't have an expansion port in their heads and their senses and abilities are more akin to those of humans.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"They're mostly for human stand-ins, while my line is slightly more work-oriented."
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, I see."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh yeah, I think I saw the concert poster outside the bar."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Poster...?
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You work here, you should know which one!"
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... kinda forget things on that entryway from time to time. All because of Didi and Gogo.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Who?
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The vending machines outside. They blabber so much I've learned to ignore anything on the door.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh! And here I was wondering why their volumes were reduced so much.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They're interesting to talk with, they just talk... so... much."
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can actually get physically sick from listening to them for too long.
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's something I've been meaning to ask you...
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yes, I'm single and I don't mind that you're a girl."
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you actually mind what anyone is?
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Not at all.
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, it's not about that..."
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do all DFC-72s look like kids?
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yes and no.
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Out of factory, we look like kids because our development needs to be as close to human as possible."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then you look like babies outside the factory?
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Nope, every fresh DFC-72 looks about 10 to 13. It makes it easier to upgrade later."
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Upgrade?
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Once a DFC-72 passes three ""maturity tests"" it can opt for a factory upgrade."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Said upgrade alters its body to something older.
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Some go for it, some don't."
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you go through it?
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I don't know. Right now, I'm a rarity."
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You don't find many like me in my line of work, so I have an advantage."
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And I really need that advantage, you know?"
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"When people hire me, half the time it's not because I'm me."
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The amount of roleplaying I have to do on a normal night is ridiculous.
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, if I stop looking underaged, I'll lose my advantage over everyone else."
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I didn't think about it that way.
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Should I think about it at all?)
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I mean, maybe I'll go through with it if I ever decide to retire or something."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But right now I'm just fine the way I am!
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Good evening Gil.
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill & Gillian,Welcome to...!
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill & Gillian,...
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Does that happen a lot?
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not really.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,It would happen less if Jill would just let people call her Jules.
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Call me Jules and I'll make sure every time you sit, you'll hear the *cling* of your shaker."
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Fine, fine..."
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I'll be with you in a minute, Jamie. Just let me finish here."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Sure, no hurry."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hello sailor.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Hello, young lady."
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Just call me Dorothy. You're Jamie, right?"
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Nice to meet you, Dorothy."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, hey! Let me buy you a drink!"
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Oh, I couldn't let you do that..."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I insist! I got a hefty bonus the other day and today I'm in a good mood.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I suppose it'd be impolite of me to reject...
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Sure, I'll take your offer."
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yay! Honey, I'll have a big Sunshine Cloud."
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I'll be fine with just a Gut Punch.
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Come on! Don't be stingy! Ask for something more expensive!
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I'd rather not.
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, that girl puts me on edge with the way she addresses people.)"
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then. Let me get your orders.
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here and here.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thank you!
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"All in order. Thank you, Dorothy."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Don't mention it.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,And thank you Jill.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's my job.
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, you mixed these up. Even though they're technically right."
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh well, I'll give you an A for effort."
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I feel bad about having the big drink. Do you want some, Dorothy?"
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nononononononono. Keep it for yourself.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yay! Now we've matching drinks!
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Seems so. Perhaps, it's nice to have a change."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, this is so not funny. I hate bitter drinks."
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Here, Jamie. Take mine."
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"You shouldn't be rude with your clients, Jill."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah...
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Is this your ""I don't know what I'm doing so have this"" order?"
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I heard restaurants do that from time to time.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,You don't seem too upset about it.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Because I really like this one.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Jamie... Jamie... Jamie...
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Hm? You want to repeat that in front of a mirror?
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"No, that doesn't cut it."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You don't have a Jamie face. You look more like an Adam or a Jack.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Just like how Fuckboy over there looks like a John to me.
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,F-Fuckboy?
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You also remind me of this one client I had a couple of years ago.
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You have the same stern look to your face.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The guy made me dress in a school uniform with a training bra and some bunny panties.
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Then he asked me to stand near the bed and say ""What are we doing for homework today?"""
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,He jumped on top of me before I could even finish.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Just... tore open the uniform's shirt, ripping the buttons in the process."
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,He shredded the training bra with his TEETH. Even ripped the panties.
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I ended up lying on the bed with this 50-something fucking me like a rabbit, while shaking me like a ragdoll."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"He started spouting nonsense, like he was trying to live all of his fantasies at the same time or something."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,He lasted a long while. I'll give him that. But I was a mess afterwards.
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Wait! Don't leave! Just ignore her... stories... dammit!
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And what do I find out a couple days later?
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The poor bastard is a mid-school teacher!
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Who knows how much he was holding inside up to that moment!
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Anyways, I'm late. Nice meeting you, Jamie. You reminded me of a damn nice dick."
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Bye, honey!"
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I... don't know how I should react.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ignore her? Take her comments in stride? Drink even more?
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's a nice girl once you get past her, um... pluckiness."
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Pluckiness, my ass! The client she scared off always leaves nice tips!"
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Hey Dorothy, may I ask you something... ah, private?"
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If you need a price list, I have a convenient card with updated fees!"
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I can give you a discount if you pay for the room or invite me to dinner.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"No, thank you. It's not about that."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Then go ahead! I don't think you can ask me something I've never been asked before.
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Is it true that the DFC-72 line leaves tracking nanomachines in the other person after... well...
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,After they violate every hole in your body regardless of its original purpose?
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...*ahem* Yes.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That's a semi-myth that nobody has tried to dispel.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's true, but also not true at the same time."
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Care to explain?
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"We do have tracking nanomachines, but they're released when the body enters alert mode."
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"When we're being assaulted or the like. That way, the authorities can chase down the attacker."
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's kind of buggy, though."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I've heard stories of DFC-72s who marry, get nervous on their wedding night, and BAM!"
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Their partners end up spending the honeymoon in jail.
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I see.
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And besides, I've modded myself so much that if any tracking nanomachines were still being released..."
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'd have to commend their tenacity to be honest.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"There's also this urban myth that those nanomachines help improve performance, but that's just silly."
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Now I get to ask you something!
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Sure, go ahead."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,How much of you is still organic?
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Just enough that my skin still heals over time.
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Come on! You know that's not what I mean!
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'll tell you that and nothing more, young lady."
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Fiiiiiiiiiiiiine, see if I care."
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, I'm going. I'll leave you with the MEANIE."
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank you, please come again."
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"That girl's something else, huh?"
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's so earnest about what she does that it's kinda hard not to root for her.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...she also has no qualms about anything whatsoever and that becomes a problem from time to time.
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Okay, I'm done here."
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Right, I'm gonna go and take my..."
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,GIIIIIIIIIL!!! I NEED YOUR GIRLY HANDS FOR A SECOND HERE!!
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Coming!
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Sorry, can you take care of him while I help her?"
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, no problem."
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I apologize if I'm taking time from your break.
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, don't worry. Sorry you'll have to deal with me."
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"You're no problem, Jill."
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but you usually seem to have a blast when Gil's the one serving you."
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, do you want something else?"
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Can you make me a Marsblast?
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That I can.
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Bitter and mind-numbing. Just like war.
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you been to war?
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Life's a war we fight every day, Jill."
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you haven't been to a war.
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Not to an official one, at least."
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Wrong astral body, Jill."
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"You know, years ago I met the lead engineer of the moon cannon."
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of guy was he?
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,A bit cocky. He said he started the project to pick up girls.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Apparently he always told them he'd name it after them.
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Seems it was *this* close to being called the Simonetta cannon instead of the Selene cannon.
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That one poem about it would've been pretty weird like that.
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Under the ever-vigilant eye of Simonetta"" doesn't have the same ring to it."
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Mercury... it was such a mystical metal ages ago.
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, if you saw a liquid that's all silvery and shiny, you'd think there's something mystical about it."
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think there was a Chinese emperor that died from drinking mercury mixed with powdered jade.
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"That would cause liver failure, mercury poisoning, and brain death."
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you know a lot about toxicology, don't you?"
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Just enough.
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(No comments?)
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, are there many gun-for-hire types in this city?"
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Not really. There's maybe two girls and three guys, myself included. Why?"
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yesterday, there was this client talking about how a White Knight killed his daughter."
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Said he sent someone to ""take care"" of the guy. That the hire brought back the guy's head."
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, I wanted to know if it sounds familiar to you."
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Hm... can you give me the guy's name?
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'd rather not. No offense.
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,None taken.
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I don't behead my targets - it's too messy.
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"If they ask me for its head, I generally just give them the whole body."
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,But that story sounds familiar...
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I think I know the guy that handled that job.
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"If it's who I think it is, then it's a fellow who goes by ""Sanders""."
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sanders...
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now that I think about it, Jamie's not your real name, is it?"
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"To tell you the truth, I don't remember my real name."
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It might as well be Jamie for all I know.
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, I see..."
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Something wrong?
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I just realized how easy it is for me to get ahold of dangerous information from dangerous people.
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No offense.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,None taken.
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It was easy because I know you won't do anything with it.
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I wouldn't be so open about that with anyone else.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You flatter m-...
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Something wrong?
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was just thinking how troublesome it'd be for common people to get rid of a human head.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Shit, he might have lied after all...)"
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,...?
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's something I've been wondering for a while now.
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,What could that be?
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,First it was how a professional assassin could be so polite and pleasant to be around...
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...but I guess your line of work doesn't have to have any bearing on your personality.
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Thanks a lot.
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What I've often wondered about is how you can be so calm here?
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Aren't you worried about police or the like?
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Well... first of all, I try to keep everything as clean as possible."
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Second, I don't come here looking for trouble, so I don't raise suspicion."
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"And finally, you can thank your boss for easing my mind about other folks."
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My boss?
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I've seen what she's done. I feel safe here.
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,She could take care of things if I went haywire.
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Haywire? You?
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Don't mind that.
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Hard not to mind it if you just said...)
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You... wouldn't happen to know how she got her mechanical arm, would you?"
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I heard she lost her original fighting a cyborg wrestler that had gone rogue.
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Just a rumor, though."
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Damn... I still don't know, then."
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Have you tried asking her?
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She told me ""It's more interesting if it's left a mystery."""
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Which leads me to believe that she might have started some of the rumors herself.
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They're believable because she's her.
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe I'll see her in action one day.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,You should. It's quite the show.
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Good news, Jill. The helmet came off and you can take your break."
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Finally.
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's always a pleasure, Jamie."
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Thank you, Jill."
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, break!"
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright!
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You could take a couple minutes more, you know?"
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm fine, thanks."
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did you get the helmet off?
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Turns out the release button was jammed with ashes.
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Whoever owns that helmet made sure to use it to the point of voiding the warranty.
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Keep it safe in case she comes back, okay?"
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Now, take it away from me before I feel compelled to put it on again."
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Yes! It's open. Great!
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Good evening. Um... what kind of place is this?
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Did I step into some kind of afterlife?
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you often enter places without knowing what they are?
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Sorta. Kinda. Yeah?
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well. This is a bar.
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,A bar? Nice! Nice!
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I don't know... I don't drink that much, to be honest."
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,What do you recommend for me?
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you normally enjoy?
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I like tea.
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's... not something I can work with.
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about flavors?
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Bitter but not too bitter?
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Sorry if it's too confusing.
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Something bitter but not too much. Maybe something bitter and girly?)
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me see what I can get you.
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Try this.
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yup, this'll do just fine. Thanks!"
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Here, try this."
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,*cough* A bit too strong for me.
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, I like this one!"
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But didn't you say you didn't have tea?
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, it's not freshly made tea or anything like that."
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,This doesn't taste like what I had in mind.
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"But then again, I wasn't clear with the order. Sorry."
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You don't look like you're from around here. What brought you by, Miss...?"
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the star that always shines in the dark night sky!
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the glow that will guide you through your sorrow!
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the northern light that will show you your dreams!
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm *Kira* Miki!
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-So... Should I call you Miss Miki or Miss Kira?
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No, you're not getting it, I'm just *Kira* Miki."
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Here, let me help you. I'll say Kira and you say Miki, okay?"
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay...
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...M-Miki.
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,No no no no! Put more spirit into it!
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,M-Miki.
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Almost there!
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Miki.
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Miki!
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!!
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill & Gillian,Miki!!
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!!
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Everyone,Miki!!
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,That's it! Are you feeling it?
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!!!
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Everyone,Miki!!!
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!!!
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Everyone,Miki!!!
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Kira!!!
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Everyone,Miki!!!!
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,And don't you ever forget it!
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,"Jill, Gillian, Dana, & Jamie",...
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What the hell am I doing out here?
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Um... where were we, Jamie?"
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"R-Right, I was telling you..."
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wow. You're good.
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Thank you!
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It's nice to know I still have it.
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Especially since I have a concert in a bit.
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Concert?
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, you're the Lilim that's putting on a concert tonight?"
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm ONE Lilim who is putting on a concert tonight. I don't know if I'm the same Lilim you're looking for.
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what are you doing all the way down here?
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, they were making last preparations for the concert so I snuck out."
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"My producer is always obnoxious while that's going on, so I just decided to leave."
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I saw one of the concert's posters outside and decided to check this place.
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Just that? Isn't that a bit... dangerous?)
801,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Won't your producer be mad when you go back?
802,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"He will, but it's not the first time I've done this."
803,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,And he still needs me to do the concert anyway.
804,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I see...
805,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How big is the concert?
806,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"We planned for a bit over 100,000 people and sold out fast."
807,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"So, we managed to secure ourselves another show in a couple of weeks."
808,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, that's nice."
809,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah. I may not have as many fans as other performers, but mine are very loyal, and that's nice."
810,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Over 100,000 is not many? Then what exactly is?)"
811,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hold on. Then, based on your little demonstration from before, I should call you ""Ms. Miki"", right?"
812,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You don't get it! Let's start from the top.
813,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll just call you Ms. Idol then.
814,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Oh! I like that.
815,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, do you have anything... soft?"
816,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Soft? As in Alcohol-free?
817,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No, I meant soft as in soft."
818,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Soft...?
819,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,L-Let's see what I can get you.
820,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Try this.
821,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah, this'll do it. Thanks!"
822,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, have you considered being more theatrical when mixing drinks?"
823,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
824,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah, you know. Like spinning bottles and lighting drinks on fire. That kind of stuff."
825,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When I was in college, I tried going to a party once."
826,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The bartender who tried those tricks gave me a nasty bump on the forehead when the bottle slipped his hand.
827,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Those kind of theatrics usually feel pointless and seem to slow down the process of actually making a drink.
828,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah, but never underestimate the power of putting on a good show."
829,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"It can feel incredible and be very rewarding, you know?"
830,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll keep it in mind.
831,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about this?
832,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It isn't what I had in mind for soft...
833,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But it'll work juuuuuuuust fine. Thanks!
834,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Soft is a bit vague, though.)"
835,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
836,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Aw man, this isn't soft."
837,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm gonna reek of alcohol.
838,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(You should've thought about that before ordering drinks in a godforsaken bar.)
839,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We have mints that can help you with that.
840,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But it would've been easier if you'd just said what you needed in your drink.
841,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Oh, I'll keep it in mind."
842,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Hmhm...
843,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, is this glass important?"
844,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Depends on why you're asking.
845,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Do you want me to sign it?
846,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh. Sure, I guess?"
847,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,No guessing! Are you sure or not?
848,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. Do as you please.
849,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Okay, then. Who should I make it out to?"
850,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Maybe for my boss? I wonder if Gil would like it though.)
851,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Your name, girl!"
852,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh! For Jill then.
853,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"""For Jill. Never lose your star. From *Kira* Miki."""
854,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, that's a pretty autograph."
855,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Thanks!
856,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, thank you."
857,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, tell me more about this concert of yours."
858,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, we're promoting my new single. It's called Shine Spark."
859,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I say that, but people still look forward to my old single, ""Your Love Is a Drug""."
860,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I'm worried I might become a one-note star, you know?"
861,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"*ahem* Anyways, the tour is called Shining Star and we've been traveling the whole continent."
862,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,We sold out of tickets fast! So we decided to give an encore concert after all others are done.
863,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, nice."
864,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But I'm not gonna bore you with details you'll find in tomorrow's newspapers anyways.
865,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I got this awesome dress that looks all cat-like.
866,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"My hairdresser, Agnes, came up with a hairstyle that makes me look like I have cat ears and all!"
867,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do cats have to do with stars?
868,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Nothing! I just like cats.
869,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,My producer suggested a bunny though.
870,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
871,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"You know, if I hadn't ended up on stage singing, I'd probably be the one planning the pyrotechnics."
872,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"When you enter the stage and the sparks start flying... that's magical, you know?"
873,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've never burned yourself with those fireworks? I've heard ugly stories from other musicians.
874,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No, not yet. I singed my hair once, but I just went for something short for a bit."
875,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,People seemed to love it. I should go back to it sometime.
876,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Um... how do Lilim get longer hair?)
877,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm guessing someone with as many fans as you has their fair share of stalkers, right?"
878,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, there are two kinds of people that obsess over me."
879,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"There are the shy ones that follow me everywhere, hiding just out of sight."
880,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,And then there's my fanclub.
881,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's the difference between them?
882,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"The fanclub follows me around a lot too, but they usually keep a distance."
883,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Actually, I think they're outside waiting for me right now."
884,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I see...
885,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,They're also very organized. They'd make pretty good soldiers.
886,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"The others, the stalkers, are a bit sneakier and don't act in groups."
887,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm guessing those stalkers must be bothersome, huh..."
888,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Actually, they're not that bad."
889,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Stalkers are nice when you get used to them.
890,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I remember one once protected me from being mugged.
891,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,There's another that breaks into my house once a week to make me breakfast.
892,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(And she fails to see the problem?)
893,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I just wish they'd leave my underwear drawer the same way they find it.
894,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I take pride in how neatly I organize my underwear, you know?"
895,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I take pride in my old liquor collection. I guess it's the same.
896,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(No, wait. It isn't!)"
897,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah! You get me, Jill."
898,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
899,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Okay, one more drink before I go."
900,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"By now, the stage should be all organized, so the fallout should have settled."
901,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Isn't it a bit late for a concert?
902,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It's part of my gimmick. I always make concerts that go from night till dawn.
903,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"In this one, I'm supposed to close with a song called Sunshine Stone."
904,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,If everything goes as planned and the weather forecast is accurate...
905,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,The sun should come up just as I reach the climax of the song.
906,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I'd be depressed if they ask for ""Your Love Is A Drug"" as an encore though..."
907,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That sounds nice.
908,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, I need to make people feel their tickets were worth the ridiculous price, you know?"
909,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Don't you think it sucks to pay for something, only to find out you shouldn't have bothered?"
910,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. One time I bought some expensive coffee in this one cafe...
911,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It tasted like filthy water with cream. I still don't know if it was the coffee or the girl that served it, but it was BAD."
912,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Man, that sucks."
913,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Speaking of which, do you have anything bitter? I really need to wake myself up."
914,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see what I can find for you.
915,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Try this.
916,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah, this works."
917,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how is it?"
918,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It could be a bit sweeter but it's delicious.
919,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I figured it was for waking you up or something so...
920,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Really nice, thanks!"
921,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
922,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"This is good, but it isn't exactly what I needed."
923,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what did you need?
924,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Something that'll wake me up, or help me sober up a bit before going back."
925,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You could've said so earlier and I would've fixed you something like that.
926,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,...the order's still wrong though.
927,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm not arguing that.
928,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I hope you aren't offended by this question, but..."
929,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Hm?
930,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I can see that you enjoy what you do, but how much of it is about the music?"
931,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I'll let you know that before becoming *Kira* Miki, I was a very accomplished pianist."
932,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I had concerts every week and part-timed in bars with a jazz band.
933,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I still write and compose my own songs!
934,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Whoa...
935,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why the change?
936,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Going from jazz and piano to idol...
937,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Have you ever thought about the power music has over people?
938,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"You could argue it's just noise, but it can make you feel a wide range of emotions."
939,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,And that power is universal. It can transcend language and culture.
940,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Being in a jazz band or performing recitals, I can only take that power to so many people."
941,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"But being an Idol, I can take that power and spread it far and wide!"
942,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Kids and adults, men and women. They all have access to my music, and I can reach every one of them!"
943,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wow...
944,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"What music do you like, Jill?"
945,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not picky, but I do prefer versions with no lyrics."
946,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Why?
947,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I like to listen to music while working, and lyrics distract me."
948,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And besides, it always bothers me when people nonchalantly start singing songs with creepy lyrics."
949,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think only half of the listeners actually care about what's being said.
950,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Oh, that's a bummer."
951,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I'd give you a copy of my latest CD, but I don't have any at the moment."
952,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry about it.
953,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, do you get flowers and that kind of stuff when you do concerts?"
954,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Yeah! Lots!
955,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I once said in an interview that I loved blue roses, so people started sending them to me!"
956,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Blue roses? There's such a thing?
957,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No, silly. They're just dyed white roses. But they're so pretty!"
958,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(You'd think blue roses would be a reality by now.)
959,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any interesting gifts you can remember?
960,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Let's see...
961,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,A guy named Danny sent a 1/60th scale chocolate sculpture of me!
962,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Her boobs were a bit smaller, though."
963,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But... he did request a video of me eating it. I feel kinda guilty for not complying.
964,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh. I had a classmate with that same fetish in high school. Lunchtime was awkward.
965,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, no. The fetish had nothing to do with it. He was the awkward one."
966,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"There was also this girl named Roxanne who sent me an oil painting, canvas and all!"
967,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It was a rendition of a photo from one of my swimwear photoshoots.
968,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"It was my favorite shot! Paul, the photographer, caught me while I was adjusting the bikini's top."
969,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It just looks so natural...
970,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Anyway, I still have that painting in my lobby."
971,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm even considering commissioning Roxanne to do another one!
972,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something tells me you're one human sacrifice away from being a pagan goddess of sorts.
973,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Calling me a goddess won't get you anywhere, you know?"
974,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You need to be more creative with your flattery.
975,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,There was an attempt that involved a sacrifice though... but the police solved that one quickly.
976,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm surprised you remember all those names.
977,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I try to remember as many of my fans' names as possible. I'd be a bad Idol if I didn't.
978,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Okay then, I'm out."
979,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Thanks for helping me pass the time, Jill!"
980,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
981,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
982,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'll make sure of it!
983,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Will she be alright?
984,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, she'll be fine."
985,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You think she'll come back?
986,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Usually I'd say no, but I honestly don't know."
987,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey Jill, have you ever lost your identity?"
988,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've lost my ID card a couple of times, yeah."
989,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No, I mean... your identity. Forgotten who you are."
990,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(What's with the change in expression?!)
991,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"N-No, not really..."
992,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I did.
993,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
994,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,*Kira* Miki is just an artist name.
995,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"At first, it was hard for me to play the part, you know?"
996,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But I gained so much satisfaction from the concerts that I decided to invest myself.
997,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,...and I overdid it.
998,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
999,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I became so invested in the character that I forgot who I was.
1000,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Who was I before I became *Kira* Miki? What did I like?
1001,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Where does *Kira* Miki end and I begin?
1002,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I... just don't know anymore.
1003,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds rough.
1004,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What drove you to such a decision?
1005,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,The fact that I know I'm performing a noble duty.
1006,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,H-How?
1007,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You have to deal with many stressful things in everyday life.
1008,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Work, debt, sickness, insecurity, the black slime that comes out of the sewers every full moon..."
1009,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You don't know what will await you every morning.
1010,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You don't know if you'll make it back to bed that night.
1011,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"When measured, the cons of life outweigh the pros."
1012,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"People need something to cling to, and for many I'm that thing."
1013,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You are?
1014,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"During my concerts, they stop being themselves for 4 hours."
1015,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"They're not a nurse, an office worker, or a store clerk."
1016,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"For those 4 hours, they're just part of the mass that goes to see an idol."
1017,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"No religion, gender, or social class divides them. They're all at the same level."
1018,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Damn...
1019,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"When not in concert, I try to give them songs that will cheer them up, that will make their lives worth living."
1020,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"When I see the people call my name from the stage, I know they're thanking me."
1021,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Thanking me for that single moment where they can be happy.
1022,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,That's what I love about the stadium. I'm down below while they're up high.
1023,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"If forgetting who I was before means that I can protect those smiles, SO BE IT!"
1024,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'll make that sacrifice as many times as needed.
1025,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Because I live for them. Because I know I help them.
1026,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the star that always shines in the dark night sky!
1027,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the glow that will guide you through your sorrow!
1028,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm the northern light that will show you your dreams!
1029,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I am *Kira* Miki!
1030,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,And don't you ever forget that.
1031,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
1032,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,FANCLUB! TO ME!
1033,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,We ride to the stadium!
1034,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...wow.
1035,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"She's something else, huh?"
1036,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I suddenly feel the urge to ditch my shift and follow.
1037,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Do you think she's telling the truth?
1038,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gimme a sec...
1039,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"According to this article, her real name is Michelle Kingston. Deployed about 2 years ago."
1040,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She did a few variety shows with her jazz band but went solo afterwards.
1041,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What was all that talk then?
1042,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She was drunk and she was a very... peculiar drunk.
1043,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Figures.
1044,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Still quite the motivational performer, though."
1045,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No doubt.
1046,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, we're done."
1047,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright.
1048,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You feel like going to that girl's concert?
1049,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, I don't think so. I don't have tickets anyway."
1050,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Boss. Does the name ""Red Comet"" ring any bells?"
1051,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Why, that was my moniker during my wrestling days."
1052,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your... huh?
1053,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's what they called me during my time in the Grand Slam Fighters.
1054,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"They saw me coming, but they couldn't stop me before I CRASHED INTO THEIR HEADS."
1055,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any reason for being red specifically?
1056,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That way I was three times faster!
1057,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,How did you find that out? Do you like wrestling?
1058,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A client mentioned it yesterday when he saw you. I just kinda remembered it.
1059,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, I see."
1060,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I should take you to a wrestling match sometime. Maybe you'll like it.
1061,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe.
1062,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In any case, Gil's cleaning the glasses today, so I'll leave now."
1063,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Take care.
1064,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, and... boss?"
1065,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Don't cram anything on your head without thinking, please."
1066,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yeah, yeah..."
1067,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Boss should clean the chicken buckets she throws out. Everyone can smell the spice from a mile away.)
