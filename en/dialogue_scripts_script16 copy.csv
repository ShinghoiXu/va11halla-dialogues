2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, Jill. I'm out to get firecrackers."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Firecrackers?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"It's New Year's, right? We need some!"
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wouldn't firecrackers scare off the do-...
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, good idea. Go ahead."
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll be back in a bit.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Even for a cat lover, you sure get excited about firecrackers a whole lot more when dogs are involved."
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I know how hypocritical it sounds, and I don't care."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Jamie's here."
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Greetings.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, let's start."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, the guy that wouldn't come back twice."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yeah, yeah. shut up."
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"By any chance, did something fly over here two weeks ago?"
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On Friday?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Yes.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There were lots of weird explosion noises throughout the night.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But as far as I understand, those were made by a flying drone or something like that."
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So it flew by here.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I take it you know what made the noise?
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Let's just keep it at whatever drone story you heard.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The noise got annoying after a while, I must say."
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So it remained in the vicinity?
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know what counts as ""in the vicinity"", but yeah."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Distant explosions all night.
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Interesting... so it didn't get far away.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Hm...
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Now, get me a Marsblast."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Well, you didn't mess up."
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I'll let this one pass.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Here we go again...
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Bravo, you fucked up."
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"If you're actually worried about how I'm doing, I'll have you know that I've been taking care of that Mozart bastard."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"He enters the house, sleeps on the couch, eats my food, and leaves until the next day."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"So, yeah. I now have a fucking hobby."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I said nothing.
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,You got me a sweet drink.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Could've been a mistake on my side.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,...
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You look happier though.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Needing to feed a ball of fur that never stays in one place. A cat that doesn't even catch mice.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Leaving hair everywhere and scratching the furniture. Yippity fucking yay.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I don't think I wanna explore your fucked up definition of happy.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Come on, cats are fine. Just the other day my Fore..."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Sorry, not interested in your crazy cat lady stories."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm not a-...
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yes, you are."
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"The change in the tone of your voice, that glint in your eyes..."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"You're a crazy cat lady, through and through. I bet you've deluded yourself into thinking he's your baby or something."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I'm not deluded, he IS my baby.)"
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Sorry, if I may interject..."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,You lookin' for a fight?
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Most certainly not.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You really think you'd stand a chance?
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're, like, half his size."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I can fight dirty.
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He kills people for a living.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,...
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I can fight dirty.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Jill, please. You make me sound like a savage."
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It would be like me saying that you get people drunk for a living.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It's not wrong, but there are better ways of saying stuff like that."
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're right, sorry."
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"And like I said, I'm not looking for a fight."
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,I just noticed you seem to like strong drinks.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,What about it?
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Well, to be honest, it's a rare sight in this bar."
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I'd even come to believe I'm the only one here who enjoys them, aside from the owner."
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"May I suggest you try a ""Suplex"" next time? It might be to your liking."
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Hm...
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,You wouldn't by any chance know of anyone with a suit of White Knight armor?
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,This looks like the kind of shady place where such info would hide.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shady place.)
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not really, no. Why?"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Engineers are paying small fortunes for those these days.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,It's a scavenger hunt for all that tech.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,It was behind closed doors for many years...
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,But now lots of people are reverse-engineering the decommissioned armors.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,It's like a gold rush to see who gets the most tech out of it.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll... let you know if I hear anything.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If I find out somebody has one, what's in it for me?"
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,The pleasure of giving me money.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about money for me?
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,What would you do with money?
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll make sure to keep the intel for myself, then."
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Not like you could gather any, anyway."
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Okay, let's try this Suplex thing."
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Okay, gimme a Fringe Weaver."
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Good stuff. Like a less burning but punchier Piledriver.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I'm pretty sure this is wrong.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Hmph.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"*sigh* Right, right..."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,And you fucked up.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Say, your face looks somehow familiar, mister..."
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Call me Jamie. And you are?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"I'm Ingram. Anyway, I think I saw your face somewhere..."
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Maybe when I needed to look for a specific file at... hm...
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Did you perhaps go through a nanomachine expunge?
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"I did, actually."
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Figured as much. Only a handful of people do that.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,And almost all of them are people with Nanomachine Rejection that feel oddly suicidal.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"So, why go through the whole thing? Rejection? Need to hide something?"
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,The second one.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It's easier to remain undetected when they have no means to track you or your activity.
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I see.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How does the expunge work?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,You lie in a pressure chamber and they give you a special IV solution.
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,It causes Nanomachine Rejection while giving you the antibodies needed to prevent them from getting back in.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"For five hours you're trapped in bed while a horrible pressure builds up in your body, and nanomachines are forced out."
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,They're like little needles all over your body.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"You feel them in your eyes, in your gums, in your toes... everywhere."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"And after all that, they need to implant you with a mechanism that constantly releases the same antibodies."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ouch...
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"What are you having, Jamie?"
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,This is a Gut Punch.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yeah, should've figured."
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Hey, give me one of those."
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Seriously though, I don't know how people deal with cats."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,They're like that one roommate that never talks and just uses your house as he wants.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"And he's always rubbing himself against my leg, and..."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You seem to be enjoying yourself.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Like hell I am.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But you do. You wouldn't talk so much about the cat if you didn't like him.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's nothing wrong with cats, you know?"
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For example, Fore..."
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"No cat lady stories, please."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, you started it, talking about your own cat."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've also been talking like every little thing he does is magic.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I haven't asked about the cat at any point.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I'M the cat lady?
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,...
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"If I order something sweet, will you shut up?"
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Yeah, I love these. It looks different from yours, though."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I add a couple of extras in his, actually."
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,This... is not a Gut Punch.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,As I was saying...
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,You told me you'd shut up if I ordered this.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I never verbally agreed.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I guess this is sweet if you're a cat.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cats can't sense the taste of swee-...
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, that one was clever."
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"So where's the antibody unit they stuck you with, Jamie?"
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Inside, like all other maintenance systems."
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"It can be troublesome at times, but the perks of not having nanomachines in the body outweigh the cons."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,And the rest of the enhancements? Were you reconstructed or have you been adding them over time?
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Over time, either by getting a much-needed enhancement or through fixing injuries."
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I see.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Well, it was a pleasure, Jamie. But I gotta leave."
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,"Nice meeting you, Ingram."
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Don't count on it.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've said that twice.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Shut up.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Seemed like a nice guy.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I won't call him a bastard, but he's not the nicest in the bunch."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jamie,Maybe you caught him on a bad day?
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, I think you're just that good at bringing out the nicer side of people."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...oddly enough.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Well, I got a drink. I'm out."
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Mr. Ingram?"
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,What?
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I just wanted to say that you look... healthier. Happier.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm glad to see you like that.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So?
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nothing. Leave and say you won't come back even though you probably will.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Yeah? Well...
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Ah, fuck you."
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(That guy tires the hell out of me.)
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*pfffft* Heheheh...
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Someone's in a good mood.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Give me a Bad Touch, will you? That way you'll be in a good mood too."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfft*
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jill, you have such a petty sense of humor."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Guilty as charged.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Aaaand wrong.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what put you in a good mood?"
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh yeah, that."
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Today, my sister was supposed to be in court for all the custody proceedings."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Of course, not only does she show up later than her husband and drunk at that."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But also dressed... like she got fucked in the back of a parking lot.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"And to top it off, she forgot to even bring her kids!"
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Luckily, my parents brought them to court. The judge assigned the kids to my parents for the time being."
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So she really messed it up, huh?"
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,When they came back to the house and Dayana started throwing a temper tantrum...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She said it was lucky her husband didn't get the kids because the angst would make her jump onto the highway.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So Eva comes and says...
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""Then make sure it kills you, because we aren't dealing with you as a cripple."""
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I shouldn't reinforce that behaviour but pshahahahaha!
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't know, maybe it was the timing, but..."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I've been laughing for an hour now.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You hold quite the animosity for Dayana, don't you?"
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She and I used to be the closest friends when I was seven or eight.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We played all the time. We even slept on the same bed for a while.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...then she turned into a teen.
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We stopped playing. She had other things she wanted to do.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I could forgive all of that. I mean, the age difference and all."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But there is something in particular I still can't forgive.
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It was a day she invited her friends to the house, and I went to ask her something."
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"As I was leaving, one of her friends asked if I was her sister."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...and she said she had no little sisters.
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...ouch.
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I think that was the moment that finally broke the pedestal I held her on.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I admired her as much as a kid could admire someone, you know?"
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Little by little, that admiration wore off, until we finally reached that breaking point. I felt betrayed."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you haven't been able to forgive her after 40 years?
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hey.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...it's not that I still hold a grudge against her. But rather...
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The Dayana who said all those things so many years ago is the same Dayana that I know today.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She hasn't matured one bit.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"She's still as selfish, childish, and immature as she was back then."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"When you see her, you don't see an adult. You see an overgrown, horny teen."
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So aside from destroying any admiration I held for her, she's made sure not to fix that impression."
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But enough about me. How are you?
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Everything's fine... aside from this note.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A note?
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Remember how I told you I lashed out at my dead girlf-... dead ex's sister?
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Yeah.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I got this note from her.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's see...
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...wow, she must really feel bad about the whole thing."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,As do I.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, what's the problem then?"
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The same fear that drove me away from her in the first place.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Right.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Give a Brandtini, will you? There's a little story I wanna tell you."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is the thing. Let's start.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Whatever, let's start."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Boo!
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Oh, hell no.)"
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is the story of a girl who grew disillusioned with one of her sisters.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Soon, it became animosity, and not long after that, she distanced herself completely from said sister."
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"With time, the girl would become attached to her eldest sister, looking up to her achievements."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,All I can look at right now are those boobs.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Not now...)
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Said sister would even marry the girl's best friend not soon after.
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"And after the girl went into college, said sister would quit her job."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The sister was worried sick about leaving her baby kid alone, prompting her to quit her high-ranking job."
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,What if I hire your high-ranking lips?
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shut up.)
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The girl, even as an adult, felt... betrayed."
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Her role model sister went against everything she held her in high esteem for.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"She was no longer a child, and yet, she felt like a part of her had crumbled."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey Jo, I can lift her sweater. Do you wanna see? I bet you wanna see."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, enough."
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Enough?
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shit.)
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Peace out.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Err... I mean.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I know the girl is you and the sister is your eldest sister. Please get to the point.
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Right.
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The point is, if you don't face her, she will be heavily disappointed."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She's trying to make amends with you. That must take courage. Lots of it.
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, you're right."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,My mouth's dry. Can I get a Beer?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Thanks...
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And... wrong.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, tell me. Did you and this Gaby girl get along?"
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, yeah."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I never had brothers and sisters, but once Lenore introduced me to her as her ""sister in law""..."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She got so excited about ""having a new sister"" that she clung to me a lot."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I helped her in her studies, read books with her, played with her a lot."
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She was... she was pretty much my sister too.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I have to leave. But I'll tell you this.
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"As both a big and little sister, if you don't grant that girl the chance of talking to you..."
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll. NEVER. Forgive. You.
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, there's a small New Year's party this Saturday if you're interested."
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh! Sure, I'll be here."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Remember. I won't forgive you!
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll go take my break.
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Bwah! You were here?
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...you were quite absorbed in the conversation just now.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Jamie even said goodbye to you, didn't you hear?"
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A-Anyways, call me if anything comes up."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Jill, a kid's looking for you."
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, shit..."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Hey...
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Norma."
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Phew...)
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You're back!
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Oh, fuck you.)"
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You do know I'm not giving you any drinks, right?"
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Crap! I said it out loud.)
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Yeah, um... actually..."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I wanted to thank you!
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Phew... she thought it was for her.)
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank me?
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Well first, by not letting me drink that whole thing, you didn't let me get home smelling of alcohol."
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"I mean, even though you served me the alcohol..."
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Oh, but when I do it, you get all suspicious."
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Not now...)
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Well, for starters, by not complying and giving me alcohol."
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,Everything else would've fallen apart if I had some.
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Aw, so responsible, Jo."
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I... kinda faced my mom and told her all about the pressure she was putting on me.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,And said I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"Well, she didn't speak to me for two days."
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"After that, she told me that it'd be a waste to spend money in a university just for me to not give it my all."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"So she told me to still go to the college course, but that I was free to ""explore""."
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Glad to hear that.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"And, well... I wanted to thank you for that."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Me?
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"If I just rushed headfirst into my original plan, things would've gotten ugly."
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,"And you were right, I would be hurting her for the sake of hurting."
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,So... thank you!
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry about it.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Norma,I'll leave before it's too late outside.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Be careful.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Aw, so sweet."
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shut up.)
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Hey, Jill. Mind helping me here?"
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Make a Bleeding Jane, please."
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thanks.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Um... right.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey Jo, do you hate me?"
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Hate is a... harsh word.)
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(It's not against you directly, but rather the fact that only I can see you.)"
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Like I told you, if they wanted, they could see me."
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(And why can I?)
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You're the main character? Dunno.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...what are you?)
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,A cute girl.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Right...)
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"You okay, Jill? Making a lot of faces there."
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hm? Yeah, just remembering stuff."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Could you give me a hand here and serve a Beer, please?"
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thanks.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Thanks.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hey!
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...right.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Would you lighten up if I showed you I can interact with the environment?
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Maybe it'll spook me, but let's try.)"
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,There!
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Can't see anything.)
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You sure?
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Yup.)
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Weird.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,NOBODY EXPECTS THE DOROTHINQUISITION!
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Dorothinquisition, Dorothinquisition, Dorothinqui-OUCH! I biz my zongue."
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Can't believe I'm using the spare tongue so early in the night.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,*ahem*
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hoooooneyyyy~
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, hey Dorothy."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'm making a quick stop for a drink. Can I get a Fluffy Dream?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Thanks!
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,No time to complain!
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, before you leave..."
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What? Are you guys throwing a New Year's party too?
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yep.
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Sure, I'll be here then!"
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Well, I've got things to do, so..."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You do?
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Who does what?
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry... I... sneezed.
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Weird sneezes.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Anyway, I'm out for now."
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Oh yeah, Jo?"
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Take care of Becky, please."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Man, she was in a rush."
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who the hell is Becky?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Who's Becky?
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who's what?
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You said...
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I said nothing.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Okay, fuck that noise."
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Fireworks are sold out everywhere.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll need to get them through more... shady means.
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's gonna buy them from the internet.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She'll find them and put us all at risk of burning.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'll make sure there's an extra extinguisher at hand.
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I guess that's it for today."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You sure you're fine?
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I am. Don't worry.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Hey Jill, mind if I ask a silly question?"
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You've seen my clients, you can assume I don't mind silly questions. Silly answers can get on my nerves though."
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sorry. What did you wanna ask?
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Do you know why they call them ""Cat Boomers""?"
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I mean, I guess their second set of ears look like a cat's but..."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"The word ""Boomer"" seems so out of place."
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not so much when you consider it's not them, but their parents who were called such."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's go a bit back first.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You do know why Cat Boomers look like that, right?"
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Because they went through some anti-Nanomachine Rejection treatment while they were still a fetus, right?"
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's called the Yamazaki-Romanova treatment.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Or was it the Romanenko-Yamada treatment?
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The Roma...
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...let's call it the Catification procedure.
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It was not only the first successful genetic treatment on a fetus, but also the first way to fight Nanomachine Rejection."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Moreover, that research had a bit of a rocky story."
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Funding got cut in the middle of it, at a critical point that could make or break the whole thing."
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not to mention Zaibatsu Corp's record of not addressing Nanomachine Rejection at all.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The rest of the research was funded by Mackie Stengovich.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Was it Stengovich? Let's call him Stengovich for now.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He's a businessman whose unborn daughter got diagnosed with early Nanomachine Rejection.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Stengovich funded the research. And in a desperate move, his wife offered herself and her daughter as test subjects."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Of course, the experiment was a success."
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The girl, Silvia Stengovich, didn't die. She became the living testament of a scientific breakthrough."
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But then, the story of how things played out for Silvia got sensationalized in the media and created a weird fad."
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Parents made their unborn children go through the Catification procedure, even if they had no ailments at all."
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,All because one particular girl whose life got saved through that treatment became a media darling for a bit.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,And their parents got called Cat Boomers?
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A generation of parents obsessed with those cat-like features.
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The fad quickly passed, but the term remained in use."
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Eventually ""Cat Boomer"" just started being used for people with the protrusions instead of their parents."
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"You keep calling them Protrusions, why is that?"
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because that's what they are.
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Eh?
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You didn't think those things on their heads were ears, right?"
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, they can be moved because they're somehow connected to the facial and ear muscles."
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thus they can move like a cat's and react to their mood.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But in the end, they're just appendages with no real function."
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Huh...
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It still surprises me a bit though, that the biggest mutation they get after the treatment is just that."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Those ""ears"" are a small miracle on their own. People have been born with no eyes for less intrusive procedures."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You really thought they were functional ears, huh?"
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let's say I learned quite a bit today. Thank you.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And keep in mind I'm fucking up the terms.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't want you saying someone got protrusions because of a Catification procedure.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'll keep it in mind.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,WAIT!
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What?!
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...yeah, the guy's name was Stengovich."
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Eh?
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I just remembered Silvia Stengovich was around my age, and when I was a teen, there were some TV specials featuring her."
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I just remembered that I had the biggest crush on her.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...now that I think about it, that crush had me VERY confused back then."
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,And did you need to shout just now?
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sorry.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In any case, I'm out for the day."
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright. Careful out there.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Let's see... not here...
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Weird, I'd swear the tracks led here."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Oh, I'm at a bar. Well, that's nice."
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you something?
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Let's have a Brandtini.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,This seems right.
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Not really what I was expecting.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what brought you here? Um...
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,I think it's better if my name remains a mystery for now.
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(The registry says... error? Huh...)
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(The money's there, but the registry can't display the name properly...)"
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Still, what brought you here... um... mysterious person?"
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,I'm following Alice_Rabbit's trail.
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,I wanna know how deep the hole goes.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Trail""?"
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,The massive leak of White Knights' insider info from two weeks ago made it to global news.
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Curiosity got the best of me, so I started seeking the trail of the transmission."
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you work for someone, then?"
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"No, you could say it's for fun."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Alice_Rabbit is quite the urban legend and I wanted to study it.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, would you say Alice_Rabbit is a person or a group?"
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Excuse me?
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, there're people who say that it might as well be a group instead of just a person."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"If it can be just a group, it can also be just a symbol."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Everyone using the Alice_Rabbit moniker could be doing so as a way of staying anonymous while projecting clear intent.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"I doubt it, though."
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Alice_Rabbit's actions are too consistent.
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"It can't be a group. And if it's a group, it's most likely coordinated by just one person."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Everything seems to fit an agenda, the attacks are too consistent, and use similar methods."
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"I guess it can be hard for most people to notice, beyond the consistent usage of the same bunny avatar."
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,But the way the attacks are executed is always in the same vein.
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Not that it makes it easier to track, actually. Its tracks only get dimmer and dimmer with each attack."
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And so you came to check on what might be left behind from the last hacking job?
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"A pilgrimage of sorts, if you will."
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Say, would you mind giving me a Zen Star?"
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Ah, as nasty as I remember."
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,This isn't Zen at all.
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what have you found? Can you share?"
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Sure. Why the hell not? I'm in a good mood.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Well, whoever Alice_Rabbit is, or... are, they spent a lot of time planting ""seeds"" all over the city."
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Seeds""?"
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,There's traces of the video being streamed from up to 23 different locations.
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,All of them routers of different brands that blew up after the transmission.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Every one of them using different ISPs, some even using internet providers from outside the city."
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,There's even traces of programs that hacked into devices...
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Giving it the means to access a network for as long as the broadcast lasted.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Apparently, Alice_Rabbit also accessed devices early to make sure they'd be turned on at the right time."
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, the only thing without the transmission was my old CRT, so yeah."
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Quite the craftsmanship, let me tell you."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Left no trace whatsoever of where anything came from.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Even if you look at the metadata in the leaked files left on all devices after the transmission ended, there's nothing."
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Perfect crime, then?"
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Not perfect. Compared to other attacks, like the first leaks that started riots around here, this one is... sloppy."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"More specifically, the means of destroying evidence wasn't as effective as other occasions."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"But thanks to the commotion at the bank, any attempts to investigate further were curbed by the madness that followed."
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Well, I must keep moving."
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,"Oh, yeah."
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,TOMCAT,Name's TOMCAT by the way.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nice meeting you.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Huh, the registry cleared up too.)"
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I guess that's it for today."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You sure you're fine?
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I am, don't worry."
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright. Careful out there.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's less chilly today...
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"So, no dogs this time around?"
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They're around here somewhere, but I can't be arsed to look for them."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,So you're not a dog person.
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not that I'm not a dog person.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm just... tired of dogs right now.
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"You're not a dog person, then."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,I've never met anyone who liked a specific animal and got tired of it.
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,There's nothing wrong with not being a dog person. I'm not one either.
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Well, fuck.)"
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Think about it. Do you get tired of your cat?
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"It's not about hating them, but some people just have little tolerance for certain animals."
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"In my experience, cat people are the ones that didn't have pets in their childhood."
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Dog people, on the other hand, were most likely raised with one."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're pretty insightful today.
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"No, I'm just messing with you."
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else I can get you?
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Let's try something sweet.
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Sweet drinks take me back...
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good memories?
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,"Sour ones, actually."
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Ingram,Aaaaand wrong.
