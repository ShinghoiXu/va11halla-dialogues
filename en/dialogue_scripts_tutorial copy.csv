2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah! Hey there, Jill."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh. Hey, John."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When will you admit you have a John face, Gil?"
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,When you let people call you Jules.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Quiet.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Are you okay? You look distracted.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where's Boss?
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Dunno. She went out to buy some stuff and...
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Did you hear what I just told you?
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You said something?
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yes. That you look distracted. Very, very distracted."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's nothing. I'm just thinking about... stuff.
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What stuff?
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I have to pay rent by the 30th, which is always stressful, and -"
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Ah.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(There's also the fact that I spent a full hour yesterday apparently talking to myself.)
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Not to mention the fact that two days ago, I found out the bar is at risk of closing.)"
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(So not only is my life being shaken up, I'm apparently going crazy.)"
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(On top of that, neutering Fore left me with a completely empty wallet and I'll get evicted if I miss rent again...)"
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(And there're all the beer cans around my apartment, and...)"
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Jill!
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, did you say something?"
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...can you really work today?
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course I can!
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Let's go through the basics, then, shall we? Just in case."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"If you can make a Piano Man, I'll skip the rest. But. Bear with me for a second here, okay?"
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let's start with a Sugar Rush.
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Look for the recipe using the navigation bar in the recipe book that will show up on the top left.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"You can also sort drinks by flavors like ""Sweet"" or types like ""Manly""."
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Drag the desired amount of ingredients from their cells on the right to the shaker in the center.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil...
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"When done, press the mix button, and then press it again to stop mixing."
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Click the serve button or the drink itself to serve it and that'll be all.
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, but if the drink looks messed up, you'll need to press the Reset button and try again."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You can press Reset at any time. Even while the Shaker is moving. Don't be afraid to use it.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, I'm the one that went through the formal BTC instruction."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Then this should be no problem!
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here. Happy now?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"A little, but not quite. Let's do one more."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I know, I know. Please humor me for a bit."
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You... spent too much time mixing. It got blended and became a Sparkle Star instead.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,L-Let's try something else.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here. Happy?
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yes. Very. I stand corrected.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Now, let's get working."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,This is... not a Sugar Rush
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Um... let's try something else.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Some drinks need to be blended.
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,This is done by mixing it for over five seconds. You can tell it's being blended when the shaker starts moving faster.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You also need to check if the drink should be served on the rocks or aged.
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Check Ice and Age buttons on the side to select the one you need.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"And in case it wasn't obvious. ""On the rocks"" means you have to toggle the ""Ice"" tab."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,It should be noted that the station will add the ice after mixing.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,It's not something you should mind though. Just a fun fact.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Give me a Moonblast and I'll leave you alone.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Keep in mind what I said!
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Here, did I amuse you for long enough?"
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You did. Sorry to hold you.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Let's get working.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Huh, you actually made the Piano Man."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I was gonna leave you alone after this one, but good to see it done."
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"A-Anyways, let's start working."
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Um...
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Uh...
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You didn't blow everything when mixing. Let's leave it at that. We need to start working.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Finally.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, yeah! Before I forget!"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You can make any drink big by doubling the amount of ingredients.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"But if the recipe already has over 10 ingredients, the drink is already big."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, and if a recipe says it uses ""Optional Karmotrine"" it means you can use none or fill it to the brim."
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Optional Karmotrine doesn't count towards making a big drink, of course."
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Karmotrine is the alcoholic factor in a drink. It doesn't change the taste but the amount still has an effect.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"If you add too much of it, the client will get drunk faster. So please be mindful of that."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you done with the exposition?
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Now I am. Yeah.
