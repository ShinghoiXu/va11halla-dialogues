2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Day 2 of serving dogs. Are you ready?!
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Cheer up!
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That attitude won't make things easier for yourself.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Serving dogs won't ease things either.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you heard anything from Gil?
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Nope, but he should be having fun wherever he is."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Also, did you know we had darts?"
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I did."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Why didn't you tell me?!
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because that's the kind of stuff you should just assume.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A target board usually comes with a set of darts.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you like darts, Boss?"
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Not particularly, but now I owe an apology to someone."
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, call me if you need anything."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Sure.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, then..."
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, hey. Can I have a big Beer, please?"
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Thank god, a human.)"
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure. Coming right up.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thank you.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"This isn't big like I asked for, but whatever..."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You sure you know what a beer is?
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, I'm out of my groove."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"May I ask what do you do for these dogs, Miss... um..."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Beatrice, but everyone calls me Betty."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And why do you need to know that?
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you've been stuck with dogs all day, you'd also be curious when a human walks in."
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Fair enough. I'm their veterinarian.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They're all your clients?
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, company-issued vet."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, I have my own office, but it's in their building."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you're Betty the Ve-...
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, cram it."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sorry, not in the mood for puns right now."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll... keep it in mind.
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else I might need to avoid bringing up around you besides puns?
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Enhancements, but that's harder to shove into the conversation in the first place."
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Noted.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you have against enhancements anyway?
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They're unnatural! They go against the very idea of human evolution.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But there's a certain... wall that humans can't cross without enhancements.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not like having something replaced will automatically make you an expert in things.
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If anything, getting an enhancement sets you back until you get used to it."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, but it just makes things too easy on paper."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Anyone with money can replace their body parts and call it a day.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But... you have a point. Skill doesn't ship with enhancements. At least, not yet."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sorry for the outburst, I have... my story with enhancements."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, I don't mind. It's way more entertaining than serving drinks to TALKING DOGS."
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem* Sorry.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Heheh...
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Speaking of which, that's my job right now. Do you want another drink?"
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm fine for now.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Call me if you need anything.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Sure.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,"Hey, have you seen a red dot?"
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've seen many things in my life, but a red dot? Not today, no."
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,Do you have any red drinks?
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Red drinks?
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,"Yeah, the drink might know something!"
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,Thanks!
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,"Okay, punk. Hear me out. You're gonna tell me where that red dot went or I'll drink you!"
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,I'm not bluffing! I'll drink you all up!
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,This isn't red!
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can you see red?
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,I can SMELL red!
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,"You're hiding the dot, aren't you?!"
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh look! Over there!
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Wyrm Frigger,WHERE?!
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,"Those damn Pomeranians, they think they can come and take our jobs."
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me?
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,We've been getting some serious media attention because the company only hires Corgis.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Must be slow news day.)
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,But you know what I say? It's good that we don't hire anyone else.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,We don't need more races ruining our workplace.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,Next thing you know they'll be asking us to hire cats!
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wouldn't other races bring new skills to the company?
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,Shut up! What do you know? Now give me a Bad Touch.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*cough* alright...
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,Hmph...
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,You're just as useless as those Pomeranians.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If they can take your jobs away, doesn't that make you the useless ones?"
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Bangkok Bastard,Shut up!
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Racist dogs... what are the odds?)
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(...wait, if I can't tell the differences between them, does that make me racist too?)"
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Would it matter if you're racist against racists?)
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Bartender! Please stop dozing off. I need booze.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, what can I get you?"
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'll have a Zen Star.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thank you.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sigh* Sloppy service.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something on your mind?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Willing to lend an ear?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's in the job description... kind of.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Alright then. So, you mentioned the thing about talking dogs, I thought-"
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,- people throughout the ages have always dreamt about talking to animals.
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Nevermind the fact we could always understand their body language.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Now that we understand them, what do we find out?"
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"They're just furry, adorable little office workers."
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Actually, scratch that. I've yet to meet a FURRY office worker with half the charisma of these little guys."
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've met furry office workers?
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"*sigh* I've seen my share of the world, bartender."
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds like you're tired.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's fleas and ticks season. I AM tired.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you're tic-...
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Don't. You. Dare.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, this whole ""free bar"" thing is nice, though. I guess."
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It would've been nicer if we actually had time to get properly ready.
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,What do you mean?
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I found out about the booking yesterday as I was getting ready.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did the client ask for something special? Was there something I needed to know about them?
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My boss didn't specify anything. All she said to me was ""Pretend it's like any other day."""
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That... was a screw-up on our end, sorry."
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They were desperately looking for a place to celebrate.
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was actually surprised to find out they got a place.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why all the sudden plans? Did they forget their anniversary or something?
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"We found a place, but the Cardigans were the ones that hired it."
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Then some stupid argument arose and the Cardigans decided they didn't want to have any Pembrokes at their party.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I swear to GOD. These dogs are like annoying, little suburban kids."
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are these... Cardigans I keep hearing about?
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh, just another kind of Corgi - except with different fur colors and a slightly different attitude."
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"All of this is so silly. I've seen dogs play with cats, dogs play with other dogs..."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...and dogs mating with dogs twice their size.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, that's what happens when you have dogs mimicking their owners."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, that's the reason they are in a bar in the first place."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But I guess the media focus on the Pembrokes probably didn't help.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, if you'll excuse me... I have dogs to... yeah..."
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hm? Oh, yeah, yeah. Do your job. Don't mind me."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,Hey buddy!
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hello.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Umm... you?
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,I am? Whoa! Thanks buddy!
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I serve you?
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,"Well, a Big Sunshine Cloud would be nice."
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,Aww... ain't you a cutie? Loopie doopie poo...
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...woof.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Tortilla Pope,This is not what I wanted! Bad boy! Bad!
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not a ""boy"" though."
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,"You know what I hate, man?"
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What do you hate, dog?"
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,"Cabbages, man!"
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,They are like lettuces that decided to go to the gym!
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,They think they are a big deal because their leaves are harder.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,Guess what? I don't like them!!
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Calm down, dog. Do you want anything?"
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,For cabbages to not exist.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I meant to drink.
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,Oh... I'll have a Big Grizzly Temple then.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I can do that.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Here you go. Chill out for a bit, dog."
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,"Thanks, man."
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Cou Rage,You're worse than cabbages!
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Bartender!
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah?
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Do you have anything sweet?
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We're talking about drinks, right?"
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Are you hitting on me?
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If that's how you wanna see it.
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me see what can I get you.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And make it big.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you like them big, Miss Betty?"
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's not the size, but how you sell it. Gourmet food exists for that sole reason."
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wise words.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Thanks.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,This isn't what I ordered.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm gonna go ahead and declare that the dogs thing has thrown you off your game.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Err... yeah. Let's go with that.
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You know, I'm curious. What's the weirdest client you've ever gotten?"
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... wouldn't be able to tell you. There're many kinds of weird.
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Pick the first one that comes to mind.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, there was this one guy that spent 30 minutes arguing with himself before ordering."
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's not that weird.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He came in wearing a Velociraptor mask and wouldn't stop SCREAMING.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He left humming Moonlight Sonata afterwards.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Oh... Yeah. That's weird.
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At least he left a nice tip.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Speaking of anecdotes, can I ask what's your story with the enhancements?"
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why the interest?
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because it seems like a personal thing. It doesn't sound like it's a question of ethics.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And honestly, I'm really bored."
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Heh...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sure, I can entertain you a bit."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Back when I was a college freshman, some friends of mine decided to get their hands enhanced."
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It was around the time we all started practicing surgery.
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,They just wanted to bypass all the practice needed.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And so, they hired this shady character who would supposedly hook them up."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I only talked one of them out of it.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The others went off with the guy and got their hands chopped off.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is one of those stories that ends badly, I'm guessing."
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yeah. Four girls underwent the shady surgical procedure.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Two lost their hands, one was left an arthritic mess, and the last died on the operation table."
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"So, yeah. I'm not too fond of enhancements."
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,ESPECIALLY if they're taken in an effort to... avoid effort.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"This culture of ""become better automatically with enhancements"" really gets on my nerves."
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That story sounds so familiar... did that shady guy have a bleached moustache and tattooed black eyebrows?
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,He also talked using an electrolarynx. You've seen him?
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, but I remember news about about the police catching someone who was performing illegal surgeries."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Never thought I'd meet someone affected by him.
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's a small world, isn't it?"
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"*sigh* Well, I guess I gotta check on the dogs to see if they're fine."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, I'll keep serving them booze. Thanks for sharing that story."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, yeah..."
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,"Hey man, have you ever felt like time is moving too fast?"
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Tonight, I'm feeling like it's not moving by fast enough."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,Lucky you.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, they say that if time feels like it's going by too fast, you're having a good time."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I serve you?
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,I want a Bad Touch.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pfffft... sorry. Coming right up.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go. Have a good time out there.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,Maybe you're right. Thanks.
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,Whoa! Thank you!
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Accident,"You're obviously giving me the wrong drink to make time go by slower, right?"
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure...
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dog 5,Bartender.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dog 5,"One Brandtini, please."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dog 5,"Excuse me, the beer mat's dirty."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, I'll change it."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dog 5,"Nah, leave it like that. It already ruined the Brandtini anyway..."
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dog 5,"Hah! As I thought, this place sucks."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey bartender!
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Bar... tender, Den... barter, Tar... bender."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Your job has a funny name.
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't say.
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You're a CUTE Bard Enter. I swear, I could just eat you up!"
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please don't.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,When did you get drunk?
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I've been a little dizzy for a while now, but it just properly kicked in."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Also... Also, some of the dogs invited me over for a drink..."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Except I'm not drunk.
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Can you give me a small Brandtini? I will definitely pay you money!
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But you don't have to pay me.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Aww... will you really buy me that drink? You're so lovely~
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah... let's leave it at that.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Shucks, this is smaller than I thought..."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're in no position to drink anything more than that thimble full.
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Maybe you're right.
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Shucks, this is smaller than I thought..."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...it's a big one though.)
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Um... this is not what I asked for.
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But it's a gift. It would be rude of me to criticise it.
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Err... yeah.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, what made you become a veterinarian?"
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I lo-o-o-ove animals.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"They are so cute, so funny, so... so... HUGGABLE."
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I want to keep them happy. That's why I became a veterinarian.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's not always easy...
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But the knowledge that I've helped these cute, cuddly, squishy animals lets me sleep like a baby at night."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lovely.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Speaking of love, have you ever been in love, Rand Berte?"
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Haven't we all been in love at some point in our lives? Why?
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I need advice and you look like a nice person.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Um... sure, thanks."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Um... actually, it's about someone who is really focused on his job, so I figured you'd understand."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I see. Still, what do you need to know?"
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,How do you get the attention of someone like that?
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Of someone that's so hyper-focused on something he disregards everything else?
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Um... taking an interest in whatever he's obsessed with is a good start. But, there's really no science to this."
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Make him feel loved and special. Just like you would do with anyone else.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You sure? He's, like, really, really, REALLY obsessed..."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If he's a decent member of society? Yeah! I see no problem with that.
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I hope you're right.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm fresh off a break up and I seriously need a hug.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Oh yeah, how do I fix the fact it's a guy?"
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...beg your pardon?
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'm not into guys, but this here is a guy. What do I do?"
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh...
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Right! Need to serve dogs, sorry."
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,No need. We're leaving~
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Already?
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Don't worry, we'll come back tomorrow!"
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Right...
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Phew...
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Taking a breather?
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, not like I'm THAT busy, though..."
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fucking dogs...
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, you want anything to drink?"
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"No, some dogs gave me drinks already. I'm fine."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, alright."
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Say, Bartender, do you like your job?"
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, you're not like the usual crop of bartenders."
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The kind who are always making a big show at a disco or rave party.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why does everybody keep saying that?
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, why are you working as a veterinarian?"
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,If you wanna change the subject you can just say so.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I just did.
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Fine...
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'm a veterinarian because if I don't do it, who will?"
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I don't trust other vets. I don't feel they are actually cut for the job, so I took it upon myself to do it."
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's... quite the ambition.
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Speaking of ambition, did you start working here because this is what you wanted since high school or something?"
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a whole new can of worms I don't want to open... but no.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Life took me here, basically."
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why the question?
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I thought we were exchanging life stories with each other.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was also thinking about the whole risk versus reward thing.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,These dogs made me an offer just as I graduated.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Sometimes, I wonder if I'd have been better off taking bigger risks."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You know, the whole ""safe position versus big bet"" kind of deal."
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're comfortable with the opportunity you've been given, take it."
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If it's something that's been bothering you for a while, scratch that itch!"
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Wow, you should be a counsellor."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, it's just cheap advice."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I have to take care of the dogs. Excuse me for a bit."
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Actually, we're about to leave already."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, really?"
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yeah. Thank you for everything.
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank dog... I MEAN GOD, GOD!!"
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...dog gammit.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Done for the day, I'm guessing?"
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You might wanna get some insecticide or something to make sure we're not full of fleas.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What does the health inspector think of this stunt?
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"The health inspector is too afraid to come to this part of the city, so I'll assume he's fine with it."
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...right.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, Boss, you look tense."
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Really? Weird.
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I'll call it a day here.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Thank you for your hard work.
