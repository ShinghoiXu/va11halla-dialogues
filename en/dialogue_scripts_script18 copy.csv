2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm... hmhmhm...
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil... are you humming Shine Spark?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah! Hey, Jill."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay? Are you in love maybe?
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm? Nothing of the sort. I'm fine.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, seriously. Did you fuck?"
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Men only get so happy after they've fucked.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That's not...
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh my god, you totally fucked."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Was it Alma? Did you have seven minutes in heaven with her?
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"No, I didn't..."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In any case, congratulations! I haven't seen you this happy since... well... never."
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Today's escapades will bring us to a familiar place and...
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shit.
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, I'm out, I'm gonna..."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Not so fast, Flat Bartender! If that's even your real name."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Last time, my viewership had a weird peak while I was passed out."
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,So I'm here to find out what made people so interested!
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...eh?
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Hmhm...
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Do I have something in my face?
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,This guy totally fucked.
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Whatever. Just keep it down.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah Jill, you're he-..."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Isn't that the passed out girl from two weeks ago?
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I'm not here!
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, sorry."
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hello, Jill."
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"This is for you, Gil."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,And this is...?
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"A copy of Sunshine Stone. You've been humming that shit non-stop, so here you go."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Um... Thanks, I guess."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It's also a congratulatory gift.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,For what?
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Don't play dumb. You totally just got some.
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"It was Titty Hacker, right? You always had your eyes on her."
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I sent her a message. She'll confirm if she did the dirty with him or not.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Let me know.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,*sigh*
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll be back in my office, then."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anyway...
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You are too happy and you are too mopey. What happened?
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was right.
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That Laura girl was head over heels for him! I was right on the money!
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Um, say... that girl..."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I'm not here!
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sorry!
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Isn't she the one that passed out last time?
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Anyways...
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Betty was right and that deserves a Beer!
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you?
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm fine.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,For the occasion.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Alright!
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,WOO!!
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You're not killing my mood, Jill!"
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So the girl was actually infatuated with him?
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You should've seen her, screaming from the top of her lungs that she liked him."
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And him just standing there thinking.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Just like that!
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"In retrospect, it was a tad too cliched for my taste. *BRRRRRRR*"
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Still, I KNEW she liked him."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I was right! I was right!
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He doesn't seem particularly happy.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,He never is.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...unlike your co-worker. Holy shit, did he fuck?"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're making it too obvious, Gil."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,HOW?!
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That beaming face is unmistakable. The face of a guy that got some and enjoyed every moment.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back to Deal, though. Like I said, he seems... lost in thought."
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Victories like these are few and far between. Let me enjoy myself.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,*sigh* Can I get something non-alcoholic here?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That's not how you drown your sorrows, piece o' scrap."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'll have a Bloom Light.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thanks.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Same.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Man, aren't you the lucky bastard today."
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,WOOO! I win again!
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're not gonna get me down!
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Celebrate all you want, but I'm freaking out here."
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I know nothing about relationships! I have no idea what to do!
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, for starters..."
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"What do you think, Jill?"
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Me?
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Her?
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Betty, I've seen a few of your relationships. Remember?"
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Aside from Veronica, there's Angela, Pamela, Sandra, Rita, Monica, Erica, Tina, Mary, and Jessica."
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Or should I say...
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"""Didn't share the bed sheets,"" ""Snores like a pig,"" ""Cold feet,"" ""Shampoo waster,"" ""Chocolate addict""..."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"""Too religious,"" ""Fan of the wrong rugby team,"" ""Teetotaler,"" and ""Chews with the mouth open""?"
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"What do you think, Jill?"
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That you must be quite the heartbreaker to have so many relationships in a short period of time.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I mean about piece o' scrap's situation.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...and thank you.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not the right person for this, um... Gil?"
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hmhmhm... hmhmhmhm...
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He's still on fucking Cloud Nine.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Or is it Fucking in Cloud Nine?)
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about...
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Sneaky, sneaky..."
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I'll be damned, she actually hides pretty well.)"
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For starters, how do you feel about her?"
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I... don't know. I don't know her that well.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You could start there.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ask her out sometime, get to know her, maybe she'll change her mind, maybe you'll change yours..."
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,In the end you lose nothing by...
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,What?
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm just realizing I'm giving ""Love"" advice to a Lilim."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I don't know how well it applies to you.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Eh, these things are humans in all but organs nowadays anyways."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Even if that's the case, it's interesting that she felt that way towards him."
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Why wouldn't she? This fella is a good catch, if I do say so myself."
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And like I said: Humans in all but organs.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You've surely encountered Lilim that you sometimes forget are not humans.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"We live in weird times but hey, that only makes them more interesting."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's odd going to other cities and not seeing the same integration of Lilim though.
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, Glitch City is pretty much the cradle of social experiments involving Lilim integration, so..."
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem* A-Anyway.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just try to get to know her. You'll find out how you feel afterwards.
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, I think I'll try that."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It's quite the uninspired advice if you ask me.)
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else?
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Let's commemorate the occasion with a Piano Man and a Piano Woman!
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And now we reach a stalemate.
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I'd normally take the Piano Man, but I feel there's a symbolic value in taking the woman."
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hm...
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Why order like that then?
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Okay then. You take the man.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I don't want to.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well neith-.. ah, fuck symbolism, gimme that."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Alright then. You take the woman.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I expected a witty comment.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,This drink might be the only kind of woman I don't like.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Aaaand wrong.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sniff*
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...?
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I hate Laura.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You what?
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She's gonna take you away from me!
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You're my piece o' scrap, not hers! You're mine! Miiiiine!"
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Betty... You don't own me.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Besides, I can't, for the life of me, leave you alone."
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I feel like the moment I let you out of my sight, you'll just... crash."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Heheh...
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's not a laughing matter. You need someone making sure you aren't kicking people.
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"That's not normal, you know?"
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Besides, it's not like I have something with her yet."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You're right.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So you won't leave me?
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"*sigh* I'd worry myself sick if I left you to your own devices, honestly."
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,We should leave now.
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh yeah!
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We're holding a small New Year's party tomorrow. I don't know if you wanna come.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,We'll come!
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Are you sure?
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,We WILL.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Fine. We'll be here, Jill."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Anyway, see ya then."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Bye Bill.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Please, come again."
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, we better leave for now."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh yeah!
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hm?
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We'll be holding a small New Year's party tomorrow. You guys wanna come?
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Sure.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm in.
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cool.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,See ya then. Bye!
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Good night, Jill."
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Please, come again."
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Party? I'd love to go!
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"But I told everyone that tomorrow, I'd end the year with a party myself, so..."
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Sorry.
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I totally forgot she was already here.)
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, that was such bliss.)"
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Still, I can see how traffic spiked. Things can get fun here."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And just like the last time, I need to show my viewers something fun. Gimme something nasty."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You guys remember this bar, right? Well..."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shit...
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, I'm out, I'll-..."
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Not. So. Fast! Ms. Lana Smithee, if that's your real name."
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Fuck...)
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I went to the Augmented Eye, looking for you, and what do I find out?"
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Lana Smithee is not a person!
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's just the collective nickname everyone uses when writing crap!
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Why lie to me like that?
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I...
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, no matter."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Night's young. Give me something nasty like last time, will you?"
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,This is the...!
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,*cough*
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Hold on...
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"It was nasty, alright."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...this is not what I wanted.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,*sip*
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"...are you even trying, bartender?"
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,*sip*
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sip or talk. Not both.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And now, it's time for me to be a nice person and give you something nice!"
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"It's the second time I'm here, so it's only natural you get your own copy of my theme song!"
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, thank you."
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Don't be shy, let me give you one!"
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean it. No, thank you."
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, too late. It's already in your player!"
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That can't-... How in the everliving fuck did you do it?
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Magic!
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's bullshit.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Video Editing Magic!
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you just hack into the music player?
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Let's move on, shall we?"
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...*sigh*
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, whatever."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hey, weren't there dogs?"
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Last time you talked about this place like it was this... zany haven of sorts, but I see the same shit."
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Seriously. No decorations or anything of the like?
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Good question... where are the dogs?)
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I either haven't paid enough attention to their arrival or they haven't come.)
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Idols, newspaper managers, talking dogs. And yet this is the same old bar like last time."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I might sue you for fake advertising, you know?"
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Now that I think about it. Maybe Boss just donated money to this CIRA thing.)
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(And then tricked the dog into coming here as a ""part-timer"" for kicks.)"
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, well. Anything interesting lately?"
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I mean, it's not like I miss them, but they should at least show their faces.)"
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Hello?
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, what did you say?"
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I was asking if there were any new stories?
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is not a newspaper, you know?"
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nor is it a crazy-stories-on-demand streaming service.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,That's a big fat lie and you know it!
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But I said nothing.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Heheh!
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Err... I meant...
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""So shut that idea up."""
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah... that.
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I won't! Last time I came here, the viewership peaked for some reason. And I want to find out why!"
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Maybe pretty boy over there can tell us the story of who he fucked.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm... hmhmhm...
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He's so distracted he won't even make a retort. Amazing.
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I guess there's something worth saying, but..."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Then I want to hear iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, *Kira* Miki came yesterday again..."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You're shitting me.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You expect me to believe she came all the way here again?
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Do you even have proof like the glass from last time?
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,If I may interject.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You've been listening, Boss?"
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The walls are pretty thin.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, she did!"
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I even took a pic with her!
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(She did what?)
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Let's see...
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Why?! Why?! Why?!
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I try to make an appointment with her and she's always busy.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But you sit there and she just comes waltzing over?!
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's not fair!
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, if I knew how the hell stuff like that happened, I'd share my secrets."
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was just as baffled as you are right now.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Yeah, but I bet you're not even that much of a fan, anyway, are you?"
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not wrong...
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Can you at least tell me how nice she was as a client?
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Very graceful client much like the last time. A really nice girl.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I'm gonna give you my number. If she ever comes back, you let me know, you hear?"
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Not gonna let you keep her to yourself.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I really doubt she'll come back again though.
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,She already came twice. I'm not taking any chances!
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Agh, I need something to drown this anger with. Gimme something girly, will you?"
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay...
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Phew... let's just chill a bit...
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...it's still not fair.
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Now I'm more angry!!!
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You know, you're boring today."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You're not chatting that much, nor are you doing anything funny."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe the whole peak viewership thing is just you?
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Eh?
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Maybe this bar and me, both had nothing to do with the spike. Maybe you were just that good."
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...are you hitting on me?
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Am not.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(In fact, I'm kinda trying to get you to leave. Pronto.)"
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't be so hard on the girl. She's fun.
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Another nuisance shows up...)
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Bwaaaaaaaah! Jo hates me!
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(It's not hate, it's just...)"
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Wait, I'm not having this conversation again.)"
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Boooooring.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey, hey. You are curious right? About fuckboy's partner. Wanna know who it was?"
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Do you know?)
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Maybe, maybe not."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(That maybe not settles it then. Not taking any chances.)
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Oh, come on!"
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Um... bartender, you're making lots of faces there."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(It's nothing, really.)"
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Did the two bartenders break or something? Should I call the manager? Tech Support?
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hey, Jo. Inner and outer voice, remember?"
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fuck...
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"What? Who fucked? Aside from that guy, I mean."
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... uh...
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Say... you're oddly calm today.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, I've been getting more sleep lately."
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"That way I don't feel like if I stop speaking, I'll die."
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Crash is one hell of a drug...
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And wouldn't you know, I can actually make it Premium time if I go commando."
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But come on! I'm getting bored out of my ass here. Do something!
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not a dog. You can't just ask me to roll over, you know?"
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Mind if I entertain you a bit then?
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss?
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You and Gil take a break. I'll entertain the missy here.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...alright.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, Jill. By that I meant, take Gil with you."
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I don't want him humming to the middle of the road and right into a truck's grill.
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Heh... Grilled Gil.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright Gil, come with me."
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Eh?
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want one?
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Hm? No thanks, I don't smoke."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, I got a text from Alma."
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,BOSS! ALMA AND GIL DIDN'T FUCK!
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"WELL, THAT'S A BUMMER."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She is sending congratulations your way though.
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Tell her I said thanks... I guess.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, who was the lucky girl?"
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So it was a guy? I never thought you swung that way.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,It wasn't a guy.
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So it was a girl. And you did fuck.
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I don't feel comfortable talking about that, you know?"
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't make things easy for me though.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,How so?
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, you're pretty hard to get close to, you know?"
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You never talk about yourself. You're talkative, so long as it doesn't involve you directly."
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Teasing you is literally the only way I know to get through to you.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You make me sound like some weird loner.
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You ARE a weird loner.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At least tell me if you enjoyed the night you spent with... whoever it was.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...I did.
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good for you!
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why are you humming Sunshine Stone so much though?
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I looked up her discography and... I can't stop humming or listening to them.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...oh god. You didn't fuck the idol girl, did you?"
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"No. Why would that be a problem, though?"
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, it'd just feel... weird."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, that's that for the break. Let's go back."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Right.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, and Gil?"
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm?
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Keep in mind what I said about opening up more. I mean it.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That way we won't tease you so often.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Listening to you say that has to be the weirdest thing I've heard this year.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Aaand, that's that."
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Back.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What were you two doing back there?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fucking.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, so just chatting then."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm... hmhm...
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Holy crap, did you two really fuck?!"
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,John has the face of a man who fucked to death recently.
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"See, Gil? You're making it too obvious."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,HOW?!
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What will you have today?
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'll have a Gut Punch.
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right... eh?
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What?
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,N-Nothing...
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,H-Here...
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Stop looking at me like that!
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,H-Here.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Come on! This is wrong.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, you took me by surprise."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay? It's weird for you to order something like that.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Yeah, I'm just trying out stuff."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did you know Lilim tongues are designed to identify food using the chemical components?
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Our tongues were designed with the human ones in mind.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"For example, the first flavors that we detect are sour and bitter, just like you guys."
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I checked my personal specs and apparently, my sensitivity is set to 1.2235x."
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That makes me hate those flavors because I feel them harder.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why all that... exposition?
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, I'd lie if I say I wasn't interested, but why?"
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, after last time, I got curious and started checking how many of my systems worked in detail."
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"For example, the tips of my fingers are so sensitive to vibrations, you could make a seismograph with them."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh.
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And checking that, I've found that it's all based on how humans work."
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And that got me thinking about what you said.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I mean, for my systems to work, humans had to understand how they work."
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And after all those discoveries, they're not any more or less artificial."
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why should I be?
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I don't know, looking up all of that suddenly made me feel... real."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It was the opposite of what I felt last time, I feel like I'm here right now."
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Glad to hear that.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Alright then, let's try something sweet now."
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Ah, nice."
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,BUUUUZZZ! Wrong!
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"To be honest, it's a bit surreal for me."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What?
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm here talking to you and you're answering like any human would, you're even expressing happiness."
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I remember when I was a kid, I usually tried to strike conversations with AIs."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But after a bit, they'd just... start looping through their built-in answers, repeating the same things over and over."
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That always made me crash back into reality.
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When I think back to that, having such advanced AIs like you here right now, it's... amazing."
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, it makes my inner child happy to see something she always dreamt of."
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It helps when I feel particularly cynical.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Aw... you flatter me.
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Besides, I've always thought about humans like nature's Lilim."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The method might have been different, but we, too, evolved from a more simple form ages ago."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If Lilim manage to create biological life years from now, it will all have come full circle."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,So what should I take from this is...
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You love me?
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't overdo it.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else?
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's go with a Sugar Rush.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ok.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Even in doubt, my love for these is real."
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How romantic.
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, this is real. Real bullshit."
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfffft*
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I take it the solipsist problem got solved?
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yup.
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,All the... reality crisis started the other day.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,My mo-... guardian...
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Call her mom, nobody's judging you."
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,M-Mom decided to meet with the mother of her daughter's girlfriend.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It was a very emotional meeting. They both said they felt like they closed a long chapter.
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I was moved, but that's when it set in."
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""Why was I moved?"" ""I never met any of them, so where do these feelings come from?"""
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""Why do I feel things?"" ""Do I really feel them?"""
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""What tells me someone else isn't pressing a button to make me feel that?"""
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""What tells me I'm in my body?"" ""What is 'real'?"""
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,BOOM!
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, don't worry by the way. I'm fine."
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thank god, it's unnatural to see you down like that..."
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Man, that Gogo is a blast."
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Don't you feel like talking a bit more with Didi?
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Didi is too much of a prick, and Gogo is tired."
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Besides, I wanna talk with the bartenders."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh fuck.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, I tried. Jill, I'll be in my office."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Cute little girl Lilim!
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Camgirl!
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... fiddlesticks.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"What's your name, girl?"
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm Dorothy Haze, at your service!"
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Do you come here often?
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Are you hitting on me?
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hey Dorothy, I'm in the middle of a live stream. Do you wanna participate?"
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sure! Sounds fun!
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Okay, let's take a recommendation from you. What should I drink next?"
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Try the Sugar Rush.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Bartender! A Sugar Rush over here!
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Bar! Ten! Der!
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, what?"
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Sugar Rush, please."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Good choice, Dorothy!"
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yaay!
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wrong order, bartender!"
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Boooo!
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, what are you doing in my turf? Um..."
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Streaming-chan.
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Yes?
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I mean. That's what she calls herself."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Man, that's a tacky name."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Yeah, but it's my tacky name."
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Actually, that's not really my name."
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"What's your real name, then?"
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Behind Streaming-chan's awesome mask lies the humble Nicole Chen!
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Humble...)
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why not call yourself Streaming Chen?
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's funny that you mention it.
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You see, when I started I called myself Nico Nico Chen."
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I changed websites, so the name felt a bit out of place. Thus I became Streaming Chen."
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Everyone nicknamed me Streaming-chan though, so I just went along with it."
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh yeah, I get it."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,At one point I was gonna call myself Dolores Haze.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But then I realized the name was as subtle as a brick to the face.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Anyway. I'm here because the last time I came, I ended up with greater viewer numbers than usual."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And so, I wanted to treat my loyal audience again!"
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oooh, I see."
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, you came to the right place, especially if you're looking for some comfy fun!"
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey here might seem harsh, but you just need to crack her shell."
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,See? You just need to say the right thing at the right time and she becomes a sweetheart.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Quiet, you."
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Don't play hard to get. You know it's true.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, stream girl."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That's me.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll regret asking this, but don't you have a sponsor?"
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's weird that it's been this long without SOME advertisement.
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I HAVE, but you see..."
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"The contract with them expired, so Marvin, the business guy or whatever had to make a new one."
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"He was gonna send the draft to his lawyer as it had a couple of additions, but..."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Um...
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Let's say he got too excited with my VR model and the contract became... unreadable.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, so he used the contract to..."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Yup. He cut it into a pair of panties and rubbed it vigorously on his penis.
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I mean, you'd expect certain... principles to be upheld, even in the adult VR industry."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I reported him and he got fired, but now they're looking for a new business person thing."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Honestly, I think the paper cuts all over his dick are punishment enough."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,But I mean... why the contract?
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I don't mind it if he jacked off to an image of me, but the contract?!"
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That's money that you're soiling right there!
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I would've gone back on the deal, were it not for the owner paying me a visit and apologizing profusely."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Some people seriously...
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Ah... dick paper cuts.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I've done enough ""crazed teacher fantasies"" to know how they can be a problem."
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't think you need to have experience to understand that.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...that said, Gil's been grimacing for a full minute now."
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Don't... mind me.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Huh...
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"But you know, I like you, Dorothy. Why don't we celebrate with Beers? My treat!"
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Alright!
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Two big Beers, Honey!"
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Cheers!
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Cheers!
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Man, this big stuff is actually quite small."
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh well, cheers!"
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Kanpai!
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You have the Beer. Your viewers will enjoy it more if you drink it.
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You bring a tear to my eye, Dorothy."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Your sacrifice won't be forgotten!
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Wrong order!
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Boooooooo!
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Alright! I'm not feeling my tongue or my feet! Time to get lewd!
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did I hear lewd? Do you have any stories?
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Hmhmhm... this will be a treat for non-premium users!
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I once met a guy that insisted on doing it in a jacuzzi.
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"He didn't mind being in Premium time, so I started setting up the cameras."
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"And man, was it a challenge."
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I wasn't just gonna stream over the water. I wanted some underwater action too!
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What did you do with the bubbles and all?
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That was the least of the problems! We just turned the jets off.
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"But not only did I have to make a makeshift underwater cover, I also had to keep in mind the heat!"
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Heat isn't good with cameras.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did you try chilling the cam a bit and putting it in a bag with some filling?
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,We made something more... convoluted.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"We took a small cooler, opened a hole for the lens, and sealed it with plastic."
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I made sure things looked good through the cam and started recording.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Threw in some cooling packs, and sealed the fuck out of the cooler."
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did it need any weight?
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Yup! Luckily, the guy was into bodybuilding so we used some old dumbbells."
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,He was also ripped as fuck! But that's another story.
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It was all a success! But it's also the last time I have sex on a jacuzzi.
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Blood rushing, hot water... I felt like I was dying midway through it."
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Thank god he decided to resume the action out of the water midway through it, or I would've surely died."
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,At least the guy didn't burn himself.
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,What do you mean?
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Last time I had sex on a jacuzzi, my body got so hot, the guy almost burned his dick!"
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I considered investing in a cooling system, but it's so situational and expensive that I'll pass."
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Besides, those cooling systems require too much maintenance."
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Waaaaait! I think I should leave, but... care to join me in escapades for the rest of the night?"
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Can I plug my services at the end of the night?
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Sure!
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Then count me in! I've got the perfect stories.
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Let us be on our way then.
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Goodbye, bartender!"
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Bye, honey!"
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, let's start the story."
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You see, there was this Mega Santa..."
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Wait, seriously?!"
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...they left.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A pair made in hell.
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At least they look like they're having fun.
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(That method of filming underwater sounded convoluted as fuck though.)
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(But I guess it's hard to keep a cool head when you're horny.)
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"So, what do you do, Dorothy?"
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sex worker.
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Really? You wouldn't happen to have male co-workers, do you?"
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Am I not good enough for you?
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Getting serious? No, sorry. Fooling around maybe."
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Still, I wanna spice up some premium nights, so..."
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you have a card? I could send you some numbers and pics.
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Sure! Here you go.
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And here's mine! Just in case you change your mind.
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, is camgirling like that a good job?"
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Can you earn enough?
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,More than enough! I can even afford an apartment in a high-end district of Glitch City!
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It can be a challenge from time to time though.
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You can't just do anything and expect people to come back!
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,You need to be varied! Keep it fresh!
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's all worked out nicely though. I'm one of the top streamers on my website.
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,I even got this!
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,A pillow?
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Not just a pillow, a Dakimakura! With the website's president on it!"
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's a trophy in honor of all the money I've brought to the website.
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's even a direct line to him! I can use it to call him for tech support on the spot!
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Call him, call him!"
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Let's see...
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,None,.........
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,It's busy. Oh well.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,The only condition they stipulated for this Dakimakura is that I can't use it for... premium content.
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Not that I would have, but you know..."
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Boring nights, lonely nights, everything can be a dildo if you're brave enough..."
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,That kind of stuff.
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yeah. You tell me.
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I can show you something too, but only if you let me promote myself at the end of it all."
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Sure! Go ahead!
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Ta-chan!
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,CUUUUUUUUUUUTE!!!
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I can see you're no stranger to lewd content, but... does the streaming site allow it?"
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, first they gave me the means to stream, but my website was different from theirs."
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Eventually, the demand for adult content grew, so they added lots of gates to let people get lewd."
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They created an age gate because of you?
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Yup!
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nice!
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Is there any other streamer you feel might dethrone you?
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, MMAJunkie2040 is seriously becoming a threat by the day."
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,He got this dog to train with him and suddenly everyone got interested in mixed martial arts.
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"I wish him all the best, but... he's crazy if he thinks he'll take away my spot."
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh yeah. That guy.
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,He was better when he was fatter.
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Not only was it all the more funny, it was also more... inspiring."
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And I'm not exactly a fan of dogs either.
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Well, it's been fun, Dorothy, but I gotta go."
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Mind if I stick with you for a bit?
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Oh! By all means! Let's continue the escapade then.
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sure!
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Bye, Honey!"
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,See ya Honey!
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Should I remind Dorothy that those ""ears"" of hers are signal jammers?)"
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Nah...)
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I wonder if the stream looks distorted, though)"
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We're done, Boss."
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Man, don't you just feel great?"
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Were we in the same place?
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Here, Jill."
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What's this?
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,A bonus.
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Today I got a taste of the kind of clients you deal with and...
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...keep it up.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, tomorrow is the big day, so get ready."
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That goes for both of you!
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder if Alma finds Gil attractive...
