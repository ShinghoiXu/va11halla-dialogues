2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*yawn* G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey, Jill! Gil is in the back sorting an ingredients shipment and I've got things to do, the dog's in charge, okay? Bye!"
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, the dog what?!"
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Okay, first order: pet me."
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Pet me.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I'm in charge and I want you to pet me.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hey J!
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Won't pet you.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,You'll pet me sooner or later. They all do.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Won't!
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Will!
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You called?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He said will, not Gil."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Aaaaah.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Who the hell is Will?
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nobody!
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Don't be rude with poor Will!
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's no Will!
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Do you need me to psyche you up then?
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,SHUT UUUUP!
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Who? Me or Will?
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,AAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You go back to whatever you were doing.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...alright.
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you... standby!
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Only if you pet me.
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,GO!
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...the fuck just happened?
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, aren't we spirited today?"
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valha-...
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Virgilio?
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Why do you sound so weirded out?
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You didn't show up with a... bombastic soliloquy.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, putting up an act can be tiring, you know?"
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So it's all an act, then?"
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Wasn't it obvious?
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess...
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Would you mind getting me a Bleeding Jane?
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Bleeding Jane.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yes, this is just the thing."
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,This isn't a Bleeding Jane.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Uh... actually my name is Jane and I'm bleeding, so... um..."
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Hahaha! You can be quite creative with your excuses, Miss Bartender."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... tired of putting on an act. Care to explain?
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's a long story. And I'd honestly rather not talk about it right now.
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Fair enough. What made you change your mind, though?"
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, for one thing, it's safer for me now. The pompous buffoon act was mostly a way to avoid raising suspicion."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Safer? There's a word that's been losing meaning lately.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wait... THAT was your way of avoiding suspicion?
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Yes.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you do know how weird that sounds, right?"
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It sounds weird?
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You try not to raise suspicion, but you act in a bombastic manner that screams you're there."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,And everyone dismisses the fool as a buffoon and moves on.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...eh?
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I mean, you might be right if I were talking about hiding myself."
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,But I'm avoiding certain... crowds of people.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yes, my behaviour might call everyone's attention."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,But then everyone just decides I'm harmless and disregards me.
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"And depending on how erratic my actions are, I become harder to read."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Giving me yet another layer of enigma.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I...
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh.
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, congrats. No offense, but I fell right into your plan."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I just dismissed your actions as those of a fool and moved on.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You completely fooled me.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Thanks.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Say, can you give me something spicy?"
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Aren't you fascinated by spiciness?
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What's spicy for humans might not be spicy for other animals.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Hell, what's toxic for us might not be for other creatures."
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Do you like spicy things, bartender?"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't mind them, I guess. But I'm not really a fan."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,That neutral stance is actually weird to come across.
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Everyone either loves spicy things or hates them with passion.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you like it?
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Lots. Not only in regards to painfully spicy things, but also the way mild or slight spice adds to a meal."
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I've always had this dream of opening a curry stand.
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"As things are, I might actually pursue that dream."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me know if you do. I haven't had curry in ages now.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Not spicy enough.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I hate it when things aren't spicy enough.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It burns the tongue a bit, though."
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Not the same thing.
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Hey, bartender..."
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Call me Jill.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I wanted to apologize.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"You put up with me all this time without lashing out. I should apologize for my behaviour, and thank you at that."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry. I actually feel like I was too rude to you last time you came.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Granted, you came at a really bad time, but..."
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I should be the one apologizing. You're a client after all.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, don't. I'm actually surprised that nobody else had violently lashed out at me yet."
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're making me curious as to who you really are though.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is Virgilio even your real name?
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"It might be, it might not."
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sometimes I wonder if I'm a magnet for people who hide their identities and sordid pasts.
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, Jamie, you..."
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Um... did you say something?
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just rambling. Pay me no mind.
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, tell me. Why a steampunk museum?"
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I've always liked the steampunk aesthetic. And that whole art movement is fascinating.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's always interesting to see how certain currents mirror certain cultures.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"And in this case, how steampunk takes from Victorian culture."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Non-Victorian examples are too few and far between.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Interesting.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,...I also needed a job and the director just so happened to be a friend of mine.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now that I think about it, how did you find this bar?"
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I was... avoiding some chaps and came to this alley.
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh... again.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"""Again""?"
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In my time here, I've heard ""avoided people and ended up here"" enough times to make me believe..."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That the original owner built the bar here thinking about the runaway public.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You make me sound like a criminal.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not helping.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The expression ""runaway"" doesn't just mean people escaping the law though."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We've had people avoiding stalkers or solicitors.
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've seen people more shocked by an insistent salesman than a shady figure.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe because the salesman is a more active predator? I don't know.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A troublesome part of the city right near the shopping district.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let them know there's a bar and they'll come.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...sorry. I should stop rambling to myself so much.
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I don't mind it.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"...do you think I'm sort of criminal, though?"
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like I said: you're not helping.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But for all I know... you might be the buffoon I've seen the other days.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"In any case, can I get something bitter here?"
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,This works.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Do you like coffee, Miss Bartender?"
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"As weird as it may sound from a smoking bartender... no, I don't."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, I get it. It's not for everyone."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,This... isn't bitter.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... because you're the bitter one now!
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Don't be. It wouldn't surprise me if it became force of habit due to my weird orders before.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,That Cat Boomer the other day...
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about her? Still scared of her?
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Not really, but she looks so familiar..."
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you're mixing her up with another Cat Boomer?
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"No, that's not it..."
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,It's like the bandaged girl last time.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Even with the bandages, there's just something really familiar about her."
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you need to stop thinking about it.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Answers usually come to you when you stop stressing out.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You might be right.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,That bandaged girl that came here last time...
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about her?
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I feel like I've met her before. I've been thinking a lot, but can't put my finger on it."
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you need to stop thinking about it.
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Answers usually come to you when you stop stressing out.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You might be right.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, I leave you for now, bartender. Thanks for everything."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, hello, Mister Detective."
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(And here we are, another mute person wandering into the bar.)"
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything I can get you?
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Gut Punch.
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Oh, you got it right."
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Alright! Free drink!
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what's up now?"
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"A bit of holiday blues, you could say."
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you celebrate Mega Christmas?
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Why wouldn't I?
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You looked more like a Festivus kind of guy.
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Why does everyone keep saying that?!
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, Festivus IS a celebration going against the capitalist madness that is Mega Christmas."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(And you know... cheapskate.)
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"If you have something to say, say it."
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll refrain.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although now that I think about it, ""holiday blues"" is not really tied to a specific celebration."
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just the season.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,A season of consumerist craze.
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Mega Christmas is just a mockery of what the real Christmas once was.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I mean, the season has slowly become enslaved to the corporations over time."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"""Holiday spirit"" can only be manipulated so much."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,But then came that Turbo Male guy. He started a yearly tradition of dressing up like Santa in the ring.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Turbo Male? That can't be his ring name.
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,It is.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? Such a tacky name was accepted?
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,His partner was Buster Master and his rival was Dr. Chris Max. Tacky names were not a problem.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, I knew there was a wrestler that dressed as Santa every year."
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I also knew that the guy became insanely popular and the stunt got out of control.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And, of course, that's the part everyone sings about."
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Santa became Nega Santa thanks to the Redmond Family.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nega Santa sees the error of his ways and becomes the mighty Mega Santa, renaming the holiday Mega Christmas."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,And then every company jumped on the bandwagon and Christmas was Mega Christmas before anyone noticed.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you're telling me that the guy who somehow managed to rename the holiday...
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Went by the ring name ""Turbo Male""?"
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Yup.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That makes the whole holiday sound like a joke.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,The holiday IS a joke.
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you're telling me you don't celebrate Festivus?
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"*sigh* No, I don't."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Do you know what kind of people celebrate Festivus?
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,The kind that's so lame and bland that they can only talk about how they're better because they celebrate Festivus.
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Like those jerks who only eat Nuke and think they're better than everyone else.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything else I can get you?
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Get me a Fringe Weaver, will you?"
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Right, thanks."
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Hah! Thanks a lot.
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder if he'd be happy if I gave him thinner just because it's wrong and thus free?)
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, we both know it's not holiday blues. Why are you so down?"
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Why so interested? Are you hitting on me?
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, just bored."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Besides, you could be my dad. I'd never hit on you."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,You'd be surprised by the amount of girls that are into older men.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me rephrase it: I'd never hit on you. Period.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Whatever, I'm married, anyway."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,So you wanna know why I'm feeling down?
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you don't want to tell me, it's okay."
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Nah, there's no problem."
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Well, you see. I found the girl I was looking for..."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...in her last moments.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh... really?
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I followed her tracks and finally found her. Although to be fair, it's more like she stopped trying to cover them."
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She was just sitting in a room near some more corpses. From what I gathered later, seems it was some drug lab."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She passed herself off as a prostitute, and then proceeded to kill everyone inside."
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"When I found her, she was drugged to hell and back."
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"According to what little I could get out of her, she was dying."
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Seems the same rejection she used to kill her targets was also killing her too.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You mentioned she caused a Nanomachine Rejection of sorts, right?"
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So I'm guessing the city's nanomachines seeped into her body, causing a reaction."
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"As a psycho-for-hire, you'd think she'd have had the foresight to think about that before coming into the city."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"But anyway, I had a job to do, so I delivered her letter."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...only for her to tear it apart without reading it.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Must've been frustrating, huh?"
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, all that work for her to rip it to pieces."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I thought something like that might happen.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"To be honest, at that point, I was really just doing it for my own sense of peace."
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Why tear the letter, though?"
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Apparently, the guy wasn't exactly the best father out there."
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,She was born for experimental purposes. A living guinea pig for her father's condition.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"He was literally going to use her to test any treatment, no matter how unorthodox."
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She was experimented upon from an early age. And when she found out what her blood was capable of, she just... snapped."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"In her own words, ""I didn't have to take shit from anyone anymore, not even my 'father'""."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"So she ran away, came to the city. Became a gun for hire..."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Got trapped in that bank. Then, the rejection started to kick in..."
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Tough stuff.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"It hit me hard, you know? I kinda saw my own daughter in her at that moment."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,The anger she bore against this old man...
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,I've seen it before. Many times while my daughter was a teen.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She... my daughter was born as a boy. And back then, spent all her time angry."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I had a short fuse, so I lost control with her more often than not."
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I yelled at her, she yelled at me..."
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"When she turned 11, she started her transition process. Her behaviour changed a lot."
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"She was calmer, friendlier... but my relationship with her was already fractured."
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,It wasn't until a couple of years ago that she decided to give me a second chance.
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"I've been doing my best to make amends, but I still remember the anger on her face."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"And to see that girl, in her death throes, with that same look..."
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,...
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you shouldn't be here then.
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Huh?
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Maybe you should be with your daughter, preventing that stuff from ever happening again."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You finished your job. Take your lesson to heart and go spend time with her.
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not everyone gets second chances, so don't waste it."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Yeah, I'll do that. Thanks for everything, bartender."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Does that count as scaring a client off? Eh...)
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, any issues with the city lately? What's the word on the street?"
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Shouldn't I be asking that?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"There's nothing new, really."
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"The lynchings of White Knights stopped, so there's that."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Something about the armor. I haven't gotten much on that one yet.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"All in all, the madness following the attack on the bank seems to have settled down a bit."
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's good to hear.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have any other details about the attack emerged yet?
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,All records of whatever happened there have been long deleted.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Security cams, system logs... everything was wiped."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Whatever happened there, it's become even more of a mystery now."
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I wonder if Sei plans on testifying.)
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...does anyone know if Sei went there in the first place?)
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Maybe the wiping of everything actually protects her somehow.)
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Hey, bartender. You okay?"
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorry, got distracted."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"There's not much to say, really."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,There's the odd silly rumor here and there.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Like the vending machines' tasers malfunctioning and applying more strength.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,Or that the writer of The Last Rain In The World is actually living here as a brain in a jar.
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,But those are the kind of rumors you hear from crackheads.
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Crackheads might hold that one last piece of info you need, but you also hear crap like that."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Art,"Anyway, I'm leaving. Happy New Year, bartender."
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then... um...
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Bo-... no, wait. She's out."
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,GIL! YOU THERE?
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Yeah. Taking your break?
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me know if someone comes in.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, then."
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Gil. Finished with the back?"
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Now I've gotta ""patrol with the dog"", or whatever."
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Which means standing outside the alley and giving out flyers.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So Nacho and the other dog took a liking to you, huh?"
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Apparently.
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"So, yeah. Give me a call if you need something. I'll be nearby."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good luck.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Boss..."
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Can't talk. Meeting.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Meeting?
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Were those bottles of Hassy? Boss felt like treating herself to something expensive?)
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Excuse me, is this the Valhalla Bar?"
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It certainly is. Welcome. What can I get you?
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Actually, I'm looking for..."
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEXIIIIIIIIIII!
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,There she is.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm looking for some stuff. I'll be with you in a second!
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Don't worry. I'll just have a drink in the meantime.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"So, you're Jill?"
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know me?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,I've been keeping in touch with Dana ever since she left Neo-San Francisco.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"She always talks about you, about her sister, about her friend in Panama, about her sister..."
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,About her sister and about this dog she picked up from the street.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A dog?
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Yeah, I think she called him ""Gillian""."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...that can't be right.)
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,First I've heard of this dog.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Yeah, she told me he appeared at the door looking very pitiful."
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,And she always talks so happily about how he opens up to the people around him.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She's even asked me for help finding where he came from.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So... a dog, huh?"
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,ACHOOOOOOO!!
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Did you hear something outside?
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Probably just a dog sneezing.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Hm... let's try the Fringe Weaver.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Fringe Weaver.
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Seems right. Thanks.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Something's not right here...
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Agh! Sorry, my office is a mess so I can't let you in right now. I'll just go buy some-..."
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Take your time.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This is the first time I've seen her get excited about someone.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Well, I guess it's been almost 7 or 8 years since I last saw her."
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She had a brief stint with me at the Neo-San Francisco Police Department.
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh. Another thing to add to the oddly adventurous past of my boss.
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I can't picture her as a policewoman, though."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Well, she was more of a... collaborator."
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Everyone in the department acknowledged her abilities and she helped us from time to time.
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She was authorized to come with us but couldn't act by herself.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"She didn't have a gun or a badge, but she did have a radio to stay in touch."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"And, I'm not gonna lie, she was one of the best backup partners I've had over the years."
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She once took down a band of punks with nothing but a loaf of bread.
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A loaf of-...
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...yup, sounds like Boss."
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She requested that the next loaf have sesame seeds. Something about it hitting harder.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(So her penchant for swinging bread loaves like swords is not just some weird habit...)
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And how did she end up with the police, of all places?"
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Her old league, the Grand Slam Fighters, was fighting against the NSFW."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(NSFW?)
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,I was there because I needed to ask the owner of the league a couple of questions.
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,But then a fight broke out. Many drunkards joined the fray not too long after.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"I was gonna start evacuating the place, but before I knew it, she had already subdued the troublemakers."
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,I asked for help with the rest of the case. One thing led to another...
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was afraid that she might have become involved as an alternative to jail time.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Nah, she's not that kind of girl."
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you came all the way here for a visit?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"I'm in the middle of some investigations, actually."
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't think the Neo-San Francisco police has any say on whatever happens here.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Nah, I'm not in the police anymore. Just a simple private investigator."
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you came all the way here on a case, you can't be just a ""simple"" private investigator."
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Fair enough.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"You wouldn't by any chance have heard about a group called the ""Swap Spiders"", would you?"
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"First I hear that name, sorry."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Don't worry.
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Say, let's try this... Sugar Rush."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Yeah, this is what I've heard about."
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Something's not right... but at least you aren't serving me spoiled milk.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Alright, fuck it. Let's just hit a bar and chill."
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, you own a bar."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Doctors don't diagnose themselves, Jill."
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess you're right.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Wait, is she?)"
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Calm down. You don't need to overdo it.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,We're not dating anymore.
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, she WHAT?!"
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I was bored. She was lonely. We gave it a try. It didn't work. We ""broke up"" after less than a week."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What didn't work?
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,She was too uptight.
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,She was too Dana.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Too Dana?
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"On our first date, she got her head stuck in a bucket. Dinner became a night in a hardware store getting the thing off."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh... Too Dana. Yeah, I get it."
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...aaaaaanyways.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I haven't seen you in person in a long time, and you have to leave before New Year's. I don't want to make a mess."
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Don't try too hard.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"Seriously, don't. You'll make a mess."
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Let's just go outside and drink Hassy.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,I came all the way here to drink Hassy? I have Hassy at home.
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey, this stuff is like caviar here, thanks to the import rates."
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,I'll take your offer then.
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You go ahead while I grab some ice.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,Okay.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lexi,"A pleasure to meet you, Jill."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Boss."
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yes?
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lexi said something that got me thinking.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The relationship?
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I... actually, you got me curious. Do you swing that way, Boss?"
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Cuteness knows no boundaries.
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, what got me thinking is that she thinks Gil is a dog."
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,She does?
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, when you talk about him, she thinks you're talking about a dog."
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hm... Gil is patrolling nearby with Nacho and the other dog.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,This will be fun!
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...just don't overdo it.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Feeling lonely?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That voice...
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Hey Jo! Long time no see!
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"REALLY long time no see. Seriously, it feels like it's been over a year since I last saw you."
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I was planning on visiting you last week, but things were pretty heavy back then."
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,So I just waited in the background until the tension wore off a bit!
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Earth to Jo, I'm talking to you here."
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(If I ignore her, she'll leave.)"
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I'm not an unfathomable sense of dread. You can't just ignore me, you know?"
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,...
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Julianne Stingray, I'm talking to you!"
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,!!
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...calm down. Don't fall for her taunts.)
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(How did she know my full name though?)
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,I thought your full name was Julianne Natalie Stingray. Or did you legally remove the Natalie?
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Nevermind that, is she reading my thoughts?!)"
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Yeah, I mean... they're kinda written in the middle of the screen."
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"Hard not to see them, actually."
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Alright, that's it. I'm going crazy.)"
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,That's such a self-centered way to see the world.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You assume that you're crazy because you can't accept that this world could be weirder than you think.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,This world is amazing because of the things you just can't explain.
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,And just because only you experience something doesn't mean it's a lie or that you're crazy.
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"I mean, just look at ASMR."
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(No, I'm pretty sure that's what a crazy person would say in this scenario.)"
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You acknowledged me!
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Shit...)
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,That's good! I want...
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I'm not serving you anything.)
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,What? Why?!
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Last time you came I had to clean the drinks I served you off the floor.)
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't be like that.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(The drinks were also paid for with my money!)
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I don't know how you did it, but that set any and all plans I had for the rest of the week off balance!)"
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I was gonna buy some curry with the money I had to put up for those drinks!)
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Dog duty done. I know we have slow days, but for god's sake..."
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,You okay? You look... angry.
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I-I'm fine, good job out there."
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'm back.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Boss. What happened?"
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Meeting cut short. At least I drank the Hass-... Hassys... Hassie... the bottles.
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you okay? You look distraught.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm fine.
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(So they really can't see you. I mean, you're right in front of them.)"
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(And you're wearing... jeans under a... skirt.)
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Why? Just... why?)
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"To annoy people, of course!"
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"""Is that a new trend?"" ""What does she think she's doing?"""
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Everyone feels like it's not quite right. Everyone thinks they should call you out.
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"But they can't bring themselves to do it, because it's not THAT wrong."
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,There are things like spats after all.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,"It's uncannily right, not all that wrong, and they can't stop staring."
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...not like anyone other than me could see it though.)
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,They could see it if they wanted to.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Jill, you're making an awful lot of faces there. You okay?"
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Y-Yeah, just remembering stuff..."
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, I miss not being crazy.)"
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Boss, I'm leaving early today.)"
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you stay here!
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Who stays where?
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Crap, did I just...)"
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,You have to be the first person I've met who mixes their inner and outer voice.
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... um... I thought I saw one of the dogs near the counter. Sorry.
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, okay."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I leave a bit earlier today?
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Sure, thanks for taking care of the fort."
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,What about me?
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You haven't left yet. I'll thank you when you leave.
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,That's not what I... whatever.
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Things are pretty quiet outside.
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Jill!
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, miss Kim."
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Just call me Kim. It sounds weird to be called ""Miss""."
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You seem to be in a good mood.
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I got some money on Mega Christmas. Wouldn't you be happy?
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I'll have a Beer.
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks!
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,This doesn't seem right.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how've you been doing?"
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Pretty good, actually!"
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,My hair stopped falling out. My appetite is coming back.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I suddenly stopped feeling defeated. I actually felt like I achieved a victory!
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Like... like I got a hold of my own life.
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So nice to hear.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Oh yeah! I'll start bartender training in January, too."
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, really?"
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Yeah! I did some research and it sounded cool.
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"BTC gives you many benefits, so it sounds like a good thing to do for the time being."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I don't know if it's what I wanna do for the rest of my life, but it's a good start."
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,It'll give me time to think on the next course of action.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bit of advice: don't go for BTC housing plans unless you absolutely have to.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You have to sign a contract for at least five years of service, with a cut in pay and tips."
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was gonna go for that one but I backed down a bit at the last minute.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"How do you back down ""a bit""?"
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I took the chance when the BTC found me an apartment."
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And instead of signing the BTC contract, I just asked for a regular one."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I still have no idea how I got away with that one.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I thought those apartments were built by them or something.
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back in England, they are. They have their own real estate companies."
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Apartment complexes where they have the means to give discounted rooms to employees.
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But in this city, Realty Nua holds an unspoken real estate monopoly."
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So BTC can't easily offer such promises.
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Oh!
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Realty Nua is a bit weird as far as companies go.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Their name has become synonymous with quality, a brand built around certain expectations..."
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But the truth is that Realty Nua has done little to no work in the last ten years or so.
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Really?
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, when they started, they managed to sell and build upon plots of land that everyone gave up on."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They became a big name as far as real estate goes.
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But in reality, the company itself has actually done less than you'd think over the years."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Most of the time they're cashing in on their established properties or letting others work with them.
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I believe in the last ten years or so, they've only started around three or four new projects."
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And they're all expansions of their already established ones.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Y-You seem to know a lot about it.
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, I've just read a lot about it over time, especially after hearing my landlord ramble about them."
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I think it's all par for the course for real estate companies, really."
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But it's true that when you hear a name so much, you expect something... I don't know, different."
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But enough rambling on my side, you must be thirsty."
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you anything else?
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Let's try a Sugar Rush.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Yay!
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,This isn't... oh whatever.
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Actually, Jill, I came here today to thank you."
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Me?
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Yeah, back when I first showed up here, I was in a really rough spot."
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I was shocked. I was tired. I was a total mess.
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I even said some really mean things, but you had patience with me."
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Not to mention you helped me cool down, and your boss saved me."
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"And... I don't know, I felt like I had to tell you all that before the year ended."
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Much appreciated, thanks."
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"But anyway, how are you doing? Last time you were a bit... off."
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm better now, thanks a lot."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Glad to hear. It was weird to see you like that.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"It always felt like you were putting up a ""cool bartender"" act."
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It did?
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,You don't?
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Are you sure?
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What you saw as a ""cool bartender act"" is what everyone else has described as ""being cold""."
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, cold and cool do mean the same, but..."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, I don't try to put up that act. Sorry to disillusion you."
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm too much of a mess to do such a thing.
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Huh...
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Disappointed?
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"Surprised, actually. What led me to believe that you were putting on an act?"
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"And more importantly, how can I make use of it when I get assigned to a bar?"
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I must investigate further.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good luck with that.
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Say... let's try something bubbly now.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Thanks!
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,The bubbles are gone...
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey Jill, I'm gonna need some ice."
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Boss."
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Boss?
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, I know you."
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Heeeey. Nice to see you're fine.
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I'm more than fine! I'm alive! I'm here!
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I avoided my biggest mistake in life thanks to your timely intervention.
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,"I-I don't know what overcame me, I just felt like... like... like everything was shouting."
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,I couldn't stop the shouting so I just felt like...
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Like...
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,THANK YOU!
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Don't even mention it. I just did what I felt was right.
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Jill? Ice please.
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...right.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you alright? Did you seek help? I know a couple of people that could help you.
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Kim,Don't worry. I'm perfectly fine.
