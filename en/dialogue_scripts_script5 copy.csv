2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening...
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Huh? I didn't expect you today. I was waiting for you to call and say you wouldn't be coming or something.
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Things at the Apollo Bank are getting ugly, so that means more people will be looking for a drink."
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"*sigh* You can take a break, you know? You're quite the hard worker."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,And the streets are not exactly... safe right now.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,They've never been when you get down to it.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And besides, I can't afford to not come with the bar closing soon."
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I wonder if any bar has used impending closure as a means of getting their employees to work.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Seems like the total opposite would happen.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not to mention I get bored out of my brains in my apartment, so I'd rather come here, anyway."
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What did you say?
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nothing important.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil isn't back yet?
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Nope. I wouldn't worry too much about him though.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If you say so...
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That girl's still here?
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yup, she was sleeping so peacefully I felt bad about waking her up."
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,So... would you mind doing that for me?
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Actually... yes, I mind."
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But you're the boss, and it's kinda my fault she's here in the first place..."
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Sorry about that.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, young lady! Sleep another hour and we'll have to start charging you a motel fee."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,...*mumble*
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN... hm? Where am I?
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Oh... right... *yawn* the shoddy downtown bar...
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Let's see... all my gear is in place...
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"...and neither my pants nor my... *yawn* panties, shirt or bra have been displaced..."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Oh, it's the flat bartender! Good morning."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good evening.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Evening? Oh well, it's the best night... er... day of sleep I've had in quite some time."
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Sorry for all the trouble I may have caused you today or last night.
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,D-Don't worry.
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"You're so nice, flat bartender~"
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,Thanks for taking care of me. Bye!
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,"Hello, guys and gals! Streaming-chan's back in action with her batteries reloaded!"
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Streaming-chan,AAAAAAAAAH!! THE MOON! IT BURNS!!
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I feel like I've just unleashed something terrible unto the world.
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Come on, it's not that bad."
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Say, what's this bottle?"
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A client gave it to me yesterday... a gift of sorts, I'm guessing."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, cool."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's some sort of rum.
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Rum? Nice!
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want me to serve you a bit of it?
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hm... yeah, sure!"
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright!
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'm gonna enjoy this in my office, thanks."
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anytime.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,This... um...
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Whatever. I shouldn't be drinking at work anyways.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That sounds weird when you own a bar.
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bottle of Absinthe I had at home.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I went to have it appraised, but the guy said that without label, there's not that much value to it."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's still a nice bottle of Absinthe, though."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I see.
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you gonna serve it today?
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It looks like the Absinthe can be detected by the station's database, so it's not conunterfeit."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll serve it only if customers ask for it.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Sounds good.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want me to serve you a glass of it?
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll pass. Absinthe's not my kind of thing.
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well then, I'll be in my office. Careful with that thing."
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then...
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to serve mix and change lives.
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wait... that's not how it goes.
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(*sigh* No one here to retort.)
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, it feels lonely without Gil here...)"
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I just hope the restlessness in the streets doesn't lead to dangerous or weird types coming in here.)
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Good evening.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Holy shit, that was a record-breaking jinx!)"
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,W-Welcome to Valhalla. What can I get you?
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Let's see... I'll have a Green Fairy.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Green Fairy?
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"BLUE FAIRY! Sorry, the Absinthe bottle distracted me."
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I'll have a Blue Fairy.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Don't make a joke about becoming real... Don't make a joke about becoming real...)
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,On it.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Nice, yeah. This is the thing."
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Listen, I don't have eyes but I can still see and that's not what I ordered."
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll keep that in mind.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... um... how are you gonna...?
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... you can grab stuff. Should've figured as much.
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can drink stuff?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,And eat. I have the same system Lilim do.
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I ask you something um... err... Misssssssssssss...
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Call me Taylor. Just... Taylor.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"And yes, a cutie like you can ask me anything."
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ok Taylor.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"You have to be the first person I've met that didn't go ""Okay, Just Taylor""."
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Nah, too easy.)"
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You are... a brain in a jar, right?"
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"I'm sure not a hologram, of that I'm sure."
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Yup, I'm a bonafide human brain in a jar."
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... How...? Why...?
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,What? Does my handsomeness make you speechless?
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not something a girl sees every day. And that's saying quite a bit in these parts.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Fear not! For I have a speech prepared for these situations.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A speech?
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,You're seeing one of the 5 Great Living Bottled Brains of the world.
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,We are brains living in conditions that allow us to exist as any other humanoid creature.
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,All while computers in our jars scan our activities.
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"In a slow but steady manner, we are helping the world understand the inner workings of nature's most complex computer."
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm guessing you prepared that after being asked the same question too many times, huh?"
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Not out of exasperation or anything like that, mind you."
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I just wanted to have something thoughtful prepared.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Look! I even have a couple of pamphlets with me.
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,You want one?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure...
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What brings one of our world's five brains in jars to this place though?
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Oh, I'm from around here, actually."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I just wanted to take a walk for the first time in... quite a bit of time.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Have you come here before?
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Sadly, no. Otherwise I'd remember a cute face like yours."
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Speaking of which, can I have your name?"
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... it's Jill.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Jill? That's a really cute name.
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank you.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, weren't you scared of going outside today? What with the commotion around and all..."
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"It didn't stop you from coming here either, did it?"
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, you're right."
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,It's gonna take more than cryptic but ominous news to stop me.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're awfully energetic, did you know that?"
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Sorry, does that bother you?"
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, not at all. Just that I figured a brain in a jar wouldn't be so... happy."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"While I was alive, my body got to a point where there wasn't much I could do."
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,This new state of existence allows me to accomplish more than I ever could before.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Plus, I'm doing something that'll help people in the long run."
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Wouldn't you be happy?
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I wonder...
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Do you wanna make me happy, Jill?"
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Depends on what it takes.
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Don't worry. Just give me a Beer.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, then yeah. I'll make you happy."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Here, a Beer."
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Ah yes... no matter what happens, Beer's always good."
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"I guess you didn't want to make me happy, eh?"
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I'm sorry if I annoyed you.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, it's not that..."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's interesting, though. Just yesterday I was talking to a client about brain uploads."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,You were?
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah. We were talking about how, even if you upload your brain, you'd still be here."
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I've thought about that too.
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Do you think the you in the cybernetic environment would feel like she was indeed transferred?
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Like, would she remember everything? Like waking up someplace else and so on?"
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm... that's an interesting question.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was actually thinking earlier about being able to transfer someone's brain into a Lilim.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"One of the brains is being used in such an experiment, actually. They can make a functional Lilim."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Unfortunately, the wiring and other such stuff makes it look more creepy than anything."
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,They aren't transferring his identity or anything though. Just wiring him to a body.
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You'd think someone would rather do that than float around exposed in a jar.
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I have to admit the whole brain thing does look creepy.
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,But the body I'm telling you about is just uncanny-looking.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Speaking of uncanny, how did you feel when you saw yourself like this for the first time?"
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"It was quite a shock, actually. It didn't last too long, though. I never was too attached to my body."
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Later in my life, that was almost literal."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Taylor. May I ask something a bit... indiscreet?"
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,You can ask anything you want.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,While you had your other body... were you male or female?
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Hm... that's actually quite the question.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Especially considering I don't really know the answer either.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't?
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"I mean, I remember my name WAS Taylor."
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"In fact, I remember every detail of my life, but that the one thing's that's a bit blurry."
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Blurry?
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Yeah, the team that put me here said that it might be a side effect of the whole process..."
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,But my family and friends say that even in life I didn't put too much thought into questions about gender.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"So, in the end we're back to square one."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, don't you have pics or anything else?"
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"To be honest, I've chosen to not look too deeply into my old identity."
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Partly because I'm happier in this ambiguous state.
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,But also because I have this gut feeling I'm not psychologically prepared to see what I looked like.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I don't know... I feel like if I do I might... crumble.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Damn...
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Just out of curiosity, in a third person scenario... how should one refer to you?"
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,By my name.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess that makes sense...
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"If you absolutely need to use pronouns, refer to me like you'd refer to any other house appliance."
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"A TV or anything like that. An ""it""."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay with that?
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"In the end, even if I can speak, I'm just an object."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,That's actually something I've internalized a long time ago. Even with my original body.
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I see...
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"If that doesn't make you comfortable, feel free to use neutral pronouns."
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"To be honest, you can refer to me however you want. I don't really pay mind to that."
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But this isn't about what makes me comfortable...
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,You know what the downside to this body is?
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I can't get drunk.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,If you want to call that a downside...
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"If you wanted to drink alcohol for the taste, there are many alternatives."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Drunkenness is part of the whole experience.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why though? Lilim can get drunk with no problem.
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Yeah, but in their case, their brain's a computer attached to their body."
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Getting drunk causes their brains to reduce the input speed to their bodies.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Depending on the model, their ""drunk-subroutine"" might throw in a different behavioral cycle, even."
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,It's hard to get drunk when the whole point of you being in a jar is figuring out exactly HOW you work.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hm... yeah, you're right."
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hey Jill!
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, Alma."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Just ""Oh, Alma""? Where's the courtesy one would expect from plebeian bar staff?"
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla. What can I get you?
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...happy?
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Not when you put it that way.
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Why, hello there, beautiful."
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm? WhoAAAAAAAAAH!
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"You hurt my feelings with that, darling."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"S-S-Sorry, you don't see talking disembodied brains every day..."
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, I did work a summer in Lilim maintenance but even then, those were talking heads..."
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Oh, don't worry about it. At least you're not running or fainting."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Your name was Alma, right? I'm Taylor."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"N-Nice to meet you, Taylor."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Say, Alma. Can I buy you a drink?"
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sorry, I only date people who're at least 50% organic... and have at least one face."
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Hm... I know just what to strive for then!
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Just kidding. It'd make me happy to make you happy by buying you a drink. Does that bother you?
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I guess if Jill's the bartender, I don't have a problem with that."
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Awesome! I'll pay for your next drink then.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What will you have?
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll have a Cobalt Velvet.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And you, Taylor?"
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"I'm fine, actually."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You're gonna have me drink alone?
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I don't wanna drink that much.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, then..."
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your drink.
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Hope you enjoy it.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You know, you've been nicer to me these past minutes than at least three guys have been in the last year."
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Hm? Do you not like Alma, Jill? You messed up her drink."
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Leave her be. She's just like that.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Judging from the way you two talk, I'm guessing you've been a client here for a while now, right?"
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Only for about half a year or so, if memory serves right."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,Really? One would think it's been longer.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* It feels like it's been longer.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Shut up, you love me and you know it."
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"So, you just started coming here and that was it?"
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, the first time I came here, the other guy... speaking of which, where's Pablo?"
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gillian.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Archimedes.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Dunno. Adventuring or something.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anyways, the other guy served me the first time I came here. Nothing unusual there."
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The next time I showed up, Jill here was the one serving and... I don't know, I feel like she just gets me."
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There's this... chemistry. We... click.
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""We click"", she says..."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The fact that I feel more chemistry with her than with many other people is kinda sad, though."
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,It's always good to see a nice friendship.
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,"Sadly, it's getting late and I've gotta go."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Taylor,I'll leave you two lovely ladies alone. See ya!
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Bye.
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That Taylor sure was nice.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A bit weird at first, though."
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Apparently one of five brains being studied by scientists or something.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There's a summary of it in this pamphlet.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's see...
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh yeah, I've heard of them before. Can't believe I actually met one."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Alma, is your family really strict or something?"
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Not particularly, no. Why?"
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The other day you started mumbling something about numbers not caring about what you do.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About a 27 not caring if you have a Catholic wedding or not.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh gods, not the numbers thing..."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, My family isn't strict per se, but my mom can be... really abrasive."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"To her, the fact that I'm this old and not married or pregnant is a sign that I'm never gonna have kids."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nevermind the fact that she already has three grandkids.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I love her but she can be... well... ugh.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, yeah. I kinda get it."
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You also said the words ""I was a blossoming woman and I wasn't gonna stand for it!"""
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,After talking about some eighth grade teacher.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"*sigh* Yeah, THAT."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You see, back when my body started developing, I got really shy."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But at some point, something snapped within me."
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I wasn't feeling shy anymore, I felt... powerful."
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"My body felt like a new toy to me, one I was gonna make sure to use."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Of course there were two problems with that idea.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I was a teen, a horny teen. And I was surrounded by horny teens."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh* I'm not even ashamed. I still stand by the core moral I held back then.
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But it's one of those memories that you look back to and become terrified of how reckless you were.
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, I could've gotten pregnant... or worse."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...at that age I was always dressed in black and was obsessed with occultism.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The worst I remember was being the butt of other kids' jokes.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, you know how the old adage goes."
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""Don't compare your life to others. You don't know what they've been through."""
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nah, I wasn't comparing. Just wondering if some of that self-esteem thing would've helped me back then."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say Alma, how many people are there in your family? Just curious."
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, aside from my mom and dad, we're five sis-... sorry, four sisters and one brother."
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Funnily enough, we all have names that start with the first five letters in the alphabet."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you're the eldest one?
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"No, I'm actually the middle kid."
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're the middle kid but your name starts with an A?
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Don't think too much about it. I never said the order reflected our ages.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"My sister Carlotta's the eldest one, then there's Dayana just before me."
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Then comes Eva and at the bottom lies Bele-...
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*ahem* Sorry. The youngest one is Bernardo.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You've never been alone, I'm guessing."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Can't complain about that, I guess..."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It helps that we were never five in the same house.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"By the time Evita and Bernie were born, Dayana and Carlotta had already moved."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Speaking of family. Today, I came because I needed a break from everything that's been going on with them."
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you live with them?
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"No, but Evita and Bernie do. Not to mention I visit them almost every day."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anyway, my second-eldest sister, Dayana, just separated from her husband."
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's not even been a week but she's already got some other guy in her bed.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She left her kid with her husband's parents and pretty much forgot about them.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nevermind the fact that they need to go to school and all that.
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Damn...
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Dayana's life has always been messy, but these days she's really making it big."
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"She wants ""time for herself."" To ""live her life."""
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She didn't think about that when she married the guy at 20.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She didn't think about that when marrying a guy she had only known for like three months.
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You should take your own advice.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, I'd never marry someone who could catch my attention so quickly, okay?"
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, there was that one time when it almost happened, but I blame the damn stadium kiss cam."
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Kiss cam?
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I was going out with a guy my little sister introduced to me.
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Seems he was her friend's brother or something.
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We went out a couple of times and he invited me to a basketball game.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The mood was nice but then later, the kiss cam focused on us and instead of kissing me, he proposed!"
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I almost got caught in the mood and accepted.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I take it you rejected him... in a stadium... on the fucking kiss cam.
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We went out for like 3 weeks!
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't know. Maybe he wanted to get in my pants with the old ""sex on the wedding night"" line."
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But I honest-to-god can't understand why he thought it would be a good idea.
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That sounds too convoluted, you know? Proposing and waiting for the wedding night just for sex."
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Never underestimate the lengths a man is willing to go to get you in their bed.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I've seen more convoluted plots over the years.
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm feeling tempted to ask. But I'll pass.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want anything else?
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm? What's that bottle?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, it's just some rum a client gave me yesterday."
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A gift? What did you do?
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A good enough service, I'm guessing."
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Ca... ci... que.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Huh, interesting name."
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What does it mean?
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Cacique's the name of the chieftain in some native tribes.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see. Do you want me to serve you some of this?
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll pass. I don't have too many good memories where rum's involved.
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Get me a Fringe Weaver instead, will you?"
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One Fringe Weaver.
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of memories do you have with rum?
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nothing you need to worry about.
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Very funny.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Do you wanna see me take my clothes off while complaining that ""Global warming's a bitch?"""
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The what now?
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"What I mean is, I won't drink this."
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Then excuse me while I take it off your hands...
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,WHA?! Eh? S-Sure...
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cheers!
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"At times like these, I feel like I should've ordered the rum instead."
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You can't fail at pouring something from a bottle... right?
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some bottle of Absinthe I found at home.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's unlabeled, so it's not that valuable."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Do you know how to serve it?
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'd usually need some kind of spoon to perch a cube of sugar, but the station does all that for me..."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want some Absinthe then?
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, let's try it."
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Careful, it's a strong drink."
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll tell you if it's strong or not.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...and indeed it is, holy shit."
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay?
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll be fine. I've had worse in college.
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did you do in college by the way?
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jaeger Bombs, Giant Taco Pizzas, a cute student teacher..."
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We all did a cute student teacher at some point in college. I'm talking about studies, woman."
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I know, I know. I'm a computer engineering dropout."
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Dropout?
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I was getting fed up with the whole ""make programs for other people"" thing."
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Man, that bartending station messes up drinks."
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This looks like anything but Absinthe.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Alright, now's my turn to ask questions."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About what?
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What kind of family is your family?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well...
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm an only child. My mom and my dad split amicably.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"My mom is a violinist, so she was always away from home with the orchestra."
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I spent most of my time with my dad, my aunt, and my grandpa."
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Aside from that, I'd say my childhood was quite uneventful."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Huh... didn't you get something like your mom's artistic vein or something?
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I played the violin until I was around 16, I think."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What made you stop?
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know. I just kinda said ""That's it!"" one day and stopped."
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What about cousins or the rest of your family?
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I see very little of them, actually."
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Mainly because my dad moved away from most of them. Most of my mom's family live in France to boot.
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So your mom's French?
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Can you speak French?
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Mon aeroglisseur est plein d'anguilles.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Ooooh, what does that mean?"
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Rubbish? I don't know. I can't speak French.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I did try though, but college started and I stopped taking classes."
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Funny thing, I actually have a cousin from my mom's side that lives close by."
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But you'll be hard-pressed to make me spot him in a crowd.
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You're kinda lucky, you know? All of my mom's side of the family lives here."
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The chances of me meeting someone I'm related to on the street are ridiculously high.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But yeah, that's the primer on my family. Nothing too interesting, sadly."
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Your mom's a French violinist and you call that uninteresting?
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm wondering if your family has ever made a fuss about you being a hacker.
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""Hacker"" makes it sound too exotic. It's like if I called you a mixologist."
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Please don't, ever. Sounds like something somebody would say to make ""bartender"" sound sophisticated."
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,See?
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, ""hacker"" is a good way to summarize it, but it's not the best. I'm a security consultant."
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,People want to find flaws in the security of their systems and I do my best to pinpoint where it breaks.
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Be it Glitch City or anywhere else in the world. They need security, I'm their woman."
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You've told quite a few stories about cracking into databases to retrieve info like some sort of mercenary though.
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...that doesn't change the fact that ""hacker"" is not the best term to use."
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Makes the whole thing sound illegal when it's actually an honest job.
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Didn't you tell me you once secured some incriminating pics from a guy's cellphone?
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A MOSTLY honest job. Sheesh.
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What made you become a hacker, by the way?"
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I've always been a sucker for puzzles.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Even as a kid, I always had a sudoku or crossword with me."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But at some point, they started feeling kinda same-y."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So... when I started college, I took a course on system security. It felt like the kind of puzzle I was looking for."
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, there are all kinds of things involved in breaching net security."
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You need to attack the stuff from different angles.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And it's something that's always evolving. The whole point of everything is to strengthen security.
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Every time you think you've got the gist of it, they change everything."
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So it's kinda like an always-evolving puzzle.
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A puzzle I help make harder at that.
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh... I didn't think about it that way.
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It is less action-y than what movies make it up to be, though..."
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,No real-time frantic typing. Nothing like that.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Still, seeing my code break through something ... It's an amazing feeling."
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you have anything else?
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Give me something non-alcoholic. I wanna play it safe with the whole Absinthe thing.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I hope you haven't ""spiced-up"" this one."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alma, please..."
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm... I'll have a classy drink. Any classy drink.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here goes nothing...
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Bravo! You made me very happy.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Woo-hoo... I guess...
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yup, just what I needed. Thanks."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Boo! Wrong!
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Better luck next time.
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You know, sometimes, I feel you know me better than all the guys I've been with."
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I feel compelled to ask how many guys you've been with.
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If we're talking about serious, long-lasting relationships? Just a handful."
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Casual dating and one night stands on the other hand...
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do that? Why go through so many people?
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, it's not like I take every guy I see to bed. Who do you take me for?"
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know what I mean.
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, yeah..."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"That's... something I don't have an answer to, actually."
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Maybe I'm just a romantic that loves having someone to cuddle with... Maybe I just get lonely.
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Maybe there's a deep-seated psychological reason behind it all. Maybe I'm just horny.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Whatever the case, I just kinda feel like it's a quest I shouldn't give up yet."
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, it's not like I'm too different."
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Until recently, I too had a streak of one night stands."
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Really? What made you stop?
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...reasons.
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What is it? Tell me!
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Maybe later, it's time for my break. Come with me."
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Huh? Why? Can't I stay here away from the cold?
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't trust you. You could fit a bottle between those tits of yours, and nobody would know."
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Why not just say ""please come and let's keep talking at the back of the bar?"""
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You got the message. Now, come."
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Guide me then.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Say, Jill. What's the worst that could happen if you don't get your drinks right?"
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well... people have the right to not give me money.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If they don't pay for it, I don't get my bonus."
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No bonus means less money and no tips... which doesn't help because I have to pay bills.
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, I see..."
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you have to make an effort to pay your bills?
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nope.
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You have no idea how much I hate you right now.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, my job pays pretty well, and I'm not the kind to spend too much on things other than food and bills."
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Maybe maintenance on my hands and new equipment, but aside from that..."
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, I know! If you have trouble with your bills, why not live with me?"
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We could be roommates!
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Dunno.
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Moving my stuff through the stairs because the elevator's broken...
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Having to move my liquor collection...
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nevermind the fact that my cat's a shut-in that got VERY upset the one time I moved some furniture around.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The idea of moving just gives me a headache.
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You shouldn't take things so seriously when I say them, you know?"
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't, but I've thought about it before."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Now, I need some air. I'm gonna take my break. You wanna come?"
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Are you inviting me to the back of the bar? You should invite me to dinner first.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Every minute you waste making jokes is time taken from my break.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Fine, let's go."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, I'm taking my break. Call me if anyone comes in."
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Sure, sure."
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It sure is chilly out there...
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's kinda refreshing.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The hobo out there seems like a nice guy.
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Billy Vine? Yeah, he's a cool guy. Very respectful."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Apparently he got into some legal trouble and that's why he's like that.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Really?
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He could also just be a very nice crackhead, though."
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So... are you gonna tell me?
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Why did you stop having one night stands and all that?
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I started working here.
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know. After I started working here, I felt like I didn't need to do that anymore."
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe I was just lonely?
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Aww, how cute."
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I also got fed up with everyone complaining about me smoking on the bed.
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You're gonna burn the bed with that.
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If you ever need a hug, just let me know. You don't need one night stands for that."
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You left me thinking though. What's your... thing? Your fetish.
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You strike me as the kind to have an ""overpower"" fetish of sorts."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You wanna feel totally swayed by someone. Have consensual, yet forceful sex with your partner."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Did I hit bullseye?
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You have quite the imagination, girl."
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I have a cousin that lives like a hobo, actually."
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's a bit complicated though.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Problem is, his family has tried to get him to live with them, but his pride won't let him accept their help."
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He'd rather live on the streets for some reason.
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You can't tell with some people, sadly."
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why did he become a hobo in the first place?
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Bad investments and debts. Bank evicted him from his house.
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's a serious problem because he has epileptic attacks but refuses to take his medication.
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I just don't get what's up with him.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you ok? You look winded...
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Um... it's not windedness, it's... light-headedness."
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I'm a bit dizzy, but nothing I can't handle."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hoooooneeeeeyyyyy. Some seeeerviiiiice heeeeeeeeere.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm here. Don't scream.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oho? Were you two hanging at the back of the bar? What kind of stuff were you doing?
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just talking.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Is that what they call it these days?
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what do you want?
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Something soft, something sweet. No alcohol, please."
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Wouldn't it be the same if you just grabbed a soda from a vending machine?
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But I like you-u-u-u-u-u-u-u.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you dislike my presence so much?
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sweet and non-alcoholic, you say? Alright..."
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here. Like you asked.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,See? You don't get this kind of treatment from vending machines!
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...unless you're Lawrence.
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But he has this weird idea that good service is the same as selling lukewarm cans of cola.
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lawrence?
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,A friend of mine. He's a vending machine.
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You know... This kind of treatment is not precisely good for sales.
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Did I catch you in a bad mood?
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No no...
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, but how impolite of me."
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm?
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm lovely and my name's Dorothy, Dorothy Haze. Nice to meet you!"
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh. I'm Alma. The pleasure's mine.
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Dorothy, you say?"
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Eeyup, why?"
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Nothing, I guess I've heard about you before."
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really? What kind of stuff? Tell me! Tell me!
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Mostly about your... umm... pluckiness.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And here I was thinking it was because I'm a sex worker.
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...so much for trying to be subtle.
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Hey, I take pride in my job. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing it."
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Isn't it dangerous?
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I know how to take care of myself, thank you very much."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Where do you work, Alma?"
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'm a hacker.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Really? A full-fledged hacker?
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Not the kind that sees a computer logged into some account and says that's hacking, right?"
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"No, of course not."
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I've always been curious about how being a hacker works.
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you just start typing really fast while waiting for something to happen?
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,No...
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I can explain, but I don't know if you'll get it."
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"We won't know until you try, right?"
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Last time I said that I had to jam the plastic replica of a halogen light bulb up a grown man's ass.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,It was a success!
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*ahem* Okay then... let me try to explain in general how it works.
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's say I have to retrieve information from a company's database.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Alright!
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"First I do some research on the target. OS, servers, how the information is stored and all that."
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"There've been a couple of occasions where I had to go in blind, but they're the exception rather than the rule."
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"First, I secure things from my side."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I start working behind proxies, websites, and through other more vulnerable computers I find on the way."
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Uh-huh...
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,After that I start testing the networks.
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I go through the basic protocols, try known exploits as long as they don't trigger any alarm."
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Once I've tested the ground, the fun starts."
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I go through all the security protocols and look to bypass them.
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Sometimes I have to look deeper into the code for the password itself.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I-I see...
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Then, when I'm finally in, I go and retrieve user privileges."
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"After that, I go and try to become a super-user and get what I need."
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,H-How... do you do that?
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, there are a couple of ways..."
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I can use a premade program to hack into an already existing account.
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I can use info someone already gave me...
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But the usual way is using a buffer overflow.
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,B-Buff...
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What happens next?! WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?!
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I... create a backdoor in the system before leaving and covering my tracks...
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...I-I can't...
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I can't handle it anymore!
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Alma, hack me! Hack me like you've never hacked anything before!!"
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,E-Eh?!
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Make my buffer overflow! Create a backdoor in me! Escalate your user privileges! Find flaws in my securityyyyy!!
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,S-Sorry... I got carried away.
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No shit. What happened?
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Have you seen those movies or books where a couple does something like paint a picture or cook...
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...but they make it sound like they're having sex instead?
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Suggestive scenes, yeah."
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, that whole thing was kinda like that for me."
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Really?
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I guess humans don't really get it because their minds don't upload to networks or anything...
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But trust me, if you recorded yourself giving a REALLY detailed explanation in a really sexy voice..."
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,You'd make millions. Horny Lilim are an unexploited market.
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I see...
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, looks like my ride is here."
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your ride?
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yup, my brother-in-law came to look for me."
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it alright to ask that from him?
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's okay. I've known him since pre-school. It just so happened that he got married to my sister.
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey Dorothy, you need a ride?"
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Can you drop me by Third Street?
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, it's on the way."
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yay~ I'll take your offer then.
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Bye, honey!"
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Later, Jill."
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Dorothy... are you that kiddie sexbot?
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The one and only.
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"If I find another DFC-72 with the number 24601, I have the legal right to put it out of commission."
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, that'd make a nice movie."
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay?
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Light-headed, a bit weird, but everything's good aside from that."
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Say, Dorothy, you must have quite the stories, eh?"
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,!!!
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hehe...
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, there was this one time when a woman dressed me like a doll."
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She spent an hour putting clothes on me before slowly undressing me.
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,She asked me to stay as still as possible. I was actually falling asleep.
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But damn... that girl had very big fists and I woke up in a shocking manner, if you know what I mean."
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's a bummer I ended up sore after that, because she was awesome with her tongue."
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"On one hand, I needed minor maintenance after that session. Fisting was never my forte."
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"On the other, she gave me really cute dresses!"
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There was this one guy that was really into BDSM.
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He asked me to tie him up and started giving me orders on how to be his dominatrix.
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It was... kinda boring, you know? There was almost no fucking involved."
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I got that far with the guy looking for sex and he instead wanted me to whip him and drop candle wax on him.
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Worse still, he seemed to be really getting off on it."
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Almost reminded me of my second boyfriend and his penchant to ask me to do all the work in bed.
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It either is not my thing or I just haven't met the right person to show me how BDSM is done.
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, one time, some guy hired me because he wanted to teach his son a lesson."
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Apparently, he was getting too horny with some girl younger than him. He was 18 and the girl was 13 or 14."
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,His father thought that making him spend some time with me would scare him or something.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm not a therapist and got paid, so whatever..."
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"But oh, little did his father know. I left the poor guy asking for more."
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Ultimately, it worked though. He was left ""wanting girls with more experience"" or something like that."
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...*sigh*
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"When I was 16, I had the hots for this one guy from a neighboring city."
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, one day I decided to lure him into my room and have some fun with him."
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But my great grandma was visiting us that day, and what do I find out? We both called her Nana at the same time!"
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Turns out he was my cousin. And I wasn't gonna take risks with inbreeding.
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Maybe it was for the best. He didn't really get old in a graceful way.
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Fat, bald and not even a nice person to boot."
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Oh! Oh! There was this time with a donkey...
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, stop."
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Eh?
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I can take everything else, but I have to draw a line somewhere."
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And that line is drawn in regards to anything involving sexual acts between humanoids and non-humanoids.
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But you don't know what the story's like.
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, let's hear it."
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, the guy showed me a stable where there was a donkey in some sort of lift and..."
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, that's enough."
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But I didn't reach the part where the donkey...
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Stop it. Shut up. Don't think about continuing that particular story.
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Fiiiiiine.
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"...on second thought, maybe you're right."
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""What happens in Neo-Tijuana, stays in Neo Tijuana""."
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh! My ride's outside.
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your ride?
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yup, my bro-in-law came to pick me up."
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you really tell him to come and get you?
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There's no problem. He and I have been partners in crime since we were toddlers.
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It just so happens that he married my sister.
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, Dorothy, you need to go somewhere? I wanna hear the rest of this donkey story."
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sure! Can you drop me by Third Street?
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yup, it's on the way actually."
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Later, Jill."
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Bye, honey!"
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah... take care."
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Neo-Tijuana...)
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Wasn't the Neo prefix added during the rebuild after the Tequila Conflict with BTC?)
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Or was that New Mexico?)
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It was related to Mexico and had a prefix added but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.)
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I should check when I have the time.)
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(The street seems... noisy.)
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Oh, a client.)"
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hello, welcome to Valhalla. What can I get-..."
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Such a... small yet comfortable place.
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Truly, an oasis of spiritual drinks in the midst of the suburban desert."
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,A place where lost and corrupt souls can gather to forget their troubles for a while.
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,A nest where everyone from the most pathetic scum to the vilest trash-junkie can just sit to kill their insides.
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Truly, a real Persona Non Grata."
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"That's Latin for mysterious place, by the way. I'm so smart and philosophical."
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Alright! We got ourselves a Persona Non Grata here...)
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What will you have then?
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Seventeen.
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Excuse me?
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I said Seventeen. Seven plus teen.
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What does that mean?
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What does it mean to YOU?
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Just to be sure... 17 is about the drink you want, right?"
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Only if you want it to be.
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Okay, explain."
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The total of ingredients here add up to 17.
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Beautiful.
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,How is this a Seventeen?
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It isn't. You said 17 would only be related to your drink if I thought it was... and I think it isn't.
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ooooh, you subverted my expectations by taking me literally! Sneaky."
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what brings you here? Mister...
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I'm Armandio. Virgilio Armandio.
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,See? I introduced myself using the Asian order because that's a lot more polite.
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Riiiiiiight.
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,And I came here looking for an... otherworldly experience.
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I was passing by and saw this place is called Valhalla.
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I wanna see the souls of resting warriors, the wounded spirits of noble souls."
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"The golden hall full of never-ending banquets, the lively Valkyries looking over them..."
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...we have some arcade machines on the corner.
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,No no no... you're taking me too literally.
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"You see, I'm being poetic. I'm giving a mystical air to a mundane affair."
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I wanted to see drunk people, I wanted to see waitresses and food."
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I wanted to see the bar in all of its decadent glory.
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, you're out of luck. Today's been quite the slow day."
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not that I'm very surprised, given how things have been going in the streets, though..."
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Humans are a nasty bunch, that much is true."
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Making a ruckus, coming at each other... but that's to be expected from the only mammal to kill its own."
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm no zoologist, but I'm pretty sure that's not the case."
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Oh yeah? Then give me an example, not-zoologist bartender."
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Like I said, I don't know exact details, I just know that isn't right."
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If memory serves right, once a lion takes over a pride, every cub born from another lion is killed, or something."
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Pffft... ""Takes over a pride"", you can't take over pride. Pride isn't a tangible thing."
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"You need to stop making things up, not-zoologist bartender."
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"But going back on topic, do you know what the number seventeen means?"
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The atomic number of chlorine?
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"No, and Chloe is a name, not a number, you know?"
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The group where halogens are in the periodic table?
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Stop making up words like ""halogens"", ""periodic"", and ""table""."
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then. I give up.
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Seventeen is us.
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Every human has seventeen pairs of chromosomes. That number is the whole foundation of you and me.
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's... 23.
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What is?
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Not 17.
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, they're both primal numbers, so it's the same idea."
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Primal...)
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you want anything else?
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I'd like a single plum, floating in perfume, served in a man's hat."
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ha! You didn't... wait, you did."
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Enjoy~
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"I will, I'll drink this... umm... perfume."
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,...
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...you don't really have to...
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Yeah, that'd be silly. You win this round, bartender."
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...hold on, what?!"
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Ohoho... I didn't expect you to be able to deliver it, you know?"
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... what?
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,I asked you for an impossible order to prove the feebleness of the human condition.
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"No matter what you do, you'll never have all the answers and resources you need."
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"You can make as many drinks as you want, but you would never be able to deliver that ridiculous order."
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you still have to pay for this, you know?"
801,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Hey, bartender. Have you ever thought about death?"
802,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How?
803,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What if we're already dead? Both of us?
804,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what?
805,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What tells you I even existed before I entered that door?
806,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"How can you assure me that this ""reality"" is real and we were not, in fact, in heaven or hell all along?"
807,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,What if everything up to this point is just some stupid story written by an unemployed 20-something in his room?
808,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I could punch you to make you feel reality.)
809,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't care about any of that, actually."
810,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This reality's real for me and that's all that matters.
811,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,Such a close-minded way of seeing things.
812,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You need to... get away from the factual facts. Open your mind to things beyond your reach.
813,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,You'll never reach enlightenment if you don't start...
814,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"The Habanera has started! It means the ""twilight of the gods"" in German, by the way."
815,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Virgilio,"Well, you're on your own, bartender. Enjoy your new world order!"
816,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... what?
817,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"A couple of nearby cars exploded, it seems."
818,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh hell...
819,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me take a look out the window.
820,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Be careful.
821,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
822,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see lots of flashes in the distance. Most likely gunshots.
823,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Jill! Come here a sec.
824,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
825,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,...about 5GB of reports proving that several White Knight squads have been used to cover...
826,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,Illegal actions were released to the public by an unknown anarchist group.
827,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,We're receiving reports of several units going rogue...
828,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,...and using their weapons to hunt down anyone they find on the street.
829,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,Several counter-terrorism forces from neighboring cities have been dispatched in order to subdue...
830,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,...the crazed units after a plea from the vice-president.
831,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Newscaster,"We're still waiting for a declaration from Zaibatsu Corp's CEO on the subject, but until then..."
832,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Things are ugly in and outside of that bank, it seems."
833,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'd recommend you stay here tonight. It's too dangerous to even think about going outside.
834,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What if they break in?
835,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"They won't. Even then, the bar has quite the security system."
836,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"And I'll be here protecting you, as an added bonus."
837,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* ...yeah, I guess I'll stay tonight."
838,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll get you the spare mattress I have. Do you mind sleeping in my office?
839,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I guess it's fine."
840,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Good.
841,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,*sigh* Let's hope everything gets solved by the morning...
842,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll have Zankantou on hand, just in case."
843,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The metal bat with nails?
844,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,There's nothing it can't bash!
845,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh...
846,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Sei... Gil... Fore...)
847,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Hope everything's better by tomorrow.)
848,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Cold cold cold cold...
