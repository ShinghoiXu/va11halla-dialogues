2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, at least one of my employees showed up."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh? What about Gil?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"He mumbled something about holes and pests, and asked for a couple of days off."
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Business as usual then.
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Not... quite.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I mean us, not Gil. Business will be a tad different through the weekend."
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,We got booked.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a new one. Who made the booking?
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The Seifar Toy Company - they make toys for dogs.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It's their anniversary or something like that.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We usually don't reserve the bar. Why do it this time?
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...the clients are adorable.
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me?
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You'll see.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything special I should know?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,They'll give you a ticket to trade in for any drink they want. Just do your usual thing.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fair enough.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I'll be in my office. Call if you need me.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well then...
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,Um... excuse me. I'll have a Grizzly Temple.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,Hello...?
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(A dog...)
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(A TALKING dog...)
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A-Are you with the Seifar Toy Company?
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,Yeah. Did I arrive too early?
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No...
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(""The clients are adorable."" Son of a bitch...)"
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A Grizzly Temple, right? Coming right up."
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,Thanks!
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,What's this?
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"S-Sorry, I'm a bit off tonight. I'll do it again."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lord Pumplerump,No need. Just be careful next time.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This is gonna be a long weekend, isn't it?"
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,"Hey, is the Bronson Extract here produced using organic roots?"
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know that information.
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,Anyone I can talk to about that?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here? Right now? No.
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,But you should have that information on hand.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Every BTC-certified bar is no different from a fast food chain.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We get the same supplies as everyone else. Ask BTC officials if you want to know.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,But you should...
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,But we don't.
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,But-...
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Saying that we should over and over is not going to change reality.
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,Give me something with lots of Bronson Extract then.
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay...
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,What the hell is this?!
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your order.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,This is what Bronson Extract tastes like?!
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sorta, yeah."
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,"Well, fuck that noise. It's not worth the effort."
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* No, it's not."
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,"Yeah, this is nice enough."
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Arial Wienerton,"You pass, Bartender."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Excuse me...
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank GOD. A person.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, as much of a person as the designated driver can be."
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What I mean is... why are there so many dogs?
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why dogs? Why?
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, the Corgis created the Seifar Toy Company and they've been doing a great job, so..."
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A company run exclusively by dogs, really?"
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,And a good one at that.
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Their only problem is that they have a not-so-discreet preference for hiring Corgis exclusively.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Something about being more comfortable around their own kind.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you with them?
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I DO prefer Corgis, but..."
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I mean... are you working with them?"
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, well, I'm only here because the law requires at least one humanoid on the payroll."
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Does the law really cover such scenarios?)
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why take a job like this?
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Because it means I'm surrounded by Corgis all day long!
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Designated driver woes aside, it's the closest thing to heaven!"
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Although to be fair, I'm not much of a drinker anyway."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I see. Well, to each their own. Are you gonna drink anything?"
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Do you have anything non-alcoholic?
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see what I can fetch you.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Did you intend to make a pun?
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A pun?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Nevermind.
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thanks.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...you sure this isn't alcoholic?
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pretty sure.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Okay.
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Listen. I need to know. Is it really going to be ONLY Corgis today?
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is that ALL I'm gonna do all night? Serve the same kind of dog over and over?
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,The vast majority of them are Pembroke Welsh Corgis.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,There are a couple of Cardigan Welsh Corgis.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"But the relationship between the two breeds is a tad... difficult, so the Cardigans weren't invited"
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"So, yeah. I guess you'll be serving the same kind of dogs all night."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I mean."
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Isn't there some other human I might talk to today?
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"There's a woman on staff, but she couldn't come today."
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh boy...
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Is that a problem somehow?
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's not really a ""problem."" We've survived worse than this."
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like that time when an AA meeting came here asking for non-alcoholic stuff only.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But, just thinking about the fact that I'm serving drinks to dogs..."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That at some point all the choices in my life led to me serving drinks to a group of TALKING dogs...
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's one of those moments that makes you want to stop and rethink where your life is going.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Do you perhaps not like this job?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I do! I love every second of this job... but... DOGS!
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's like a fashion designer suddenly realizing he's been designing edible underwear.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I still don't see what your problem is with the dogs, but I'm not going to force the subject."
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I'm going to try entertaining myself for a bit."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The stuff for playing pool is underneath the table.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There are also darts in the box next to the Jukebox.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Great. Thanks for the information.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Call if you need another drink.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sure.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lady Banner,"I'm feeling happy, so I'll get EVERYONE a round!"
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Actually, it's a free bar..."
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lady Banner,I won't let you spoil my mood! I want a Fringe Weaver.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lady Banner,Still an awesome day!
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Lady Banner,Why are you so hellbent on ruining my awesome day?
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dragon Fucker,YO WHAT'S AN ALPHA MALE GOTTA DO TO GET SOME SERVICE?!
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What may I serve you?
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dragon Fucker,"Beer, and quickly!"
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Coming right up.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dragon Fucker,"Damn, you're a slow piece of shit."
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dragon Fucker,"THIS IS NOT WHAT I ASKED FOR, YOU LITTLE SHIT."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hey Boss! What was the opposite of deja vu again?
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Jamais vu!
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, that..."
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Are you having a premonition?
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something like that. That dog felt uncannily familiar.
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you bored?
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Not really. I was playing with the darts a bit ago.
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I thought about playing pool, but all the other clients are... thumb-challenged."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Sorry if this sounds rude, but why was the dart box so dusty?"
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're the first person in the year or so I've been here that has actually played with darts.
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think even my boss forgot they existed.
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"By the way, how are the dogs as clients?"
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We've had worse.
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Have you had someone come in and gnaw chairs to pieces?
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes. She was testing out her new mechanical teeth. She got banned from entering any BTC bar after that.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"With anecdotes like those, you'd think serving dogs would feel totally normal."
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You'd be wrong because even then, we were talking about humans."
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, don't get me wrong. I've served a dog or two in my time, but they usually come in with someone..."
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...and they never talk.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Now that I think about it, are these drinks bad for the dogs?"
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,NOW you worry about that?
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But no, they aren't. Only Cappuccino Monkeys are at risk if they drink those chemicals."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, you want anything to drink?"
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Surprise me. But keep it non-alcoholic.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thank you.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"This might sound weird to ask but... they talk through their collars, right?"
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's right.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How do they work?
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"It's not too hard, really. They're just translators."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,They read the dogs' brains and turn their thoughts into words.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Do keep in mind that today's dog breeds have more cognitive capacity than their ancestors.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"If you put the translators on dogs from a decade ago, they wouldn't work like they do now."
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I read something about that once."
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Another question: Why do they wear those small tuxedos?
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It's good for PR.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't say...
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, it'll be a bit before we go for the day. Any other questions?"
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes. Why the fuck do these dogs want to get drunk?
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,They see humans do it and they think it might be fun.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Just like teens, then."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Now, if you'll excuse me..."
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,...
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I serve you?
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me?
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Moonblast?
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A BIG Moonblast?
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,Moon!
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright then.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Satan's Hellper,MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON!
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Was that a good moon or a bad moon?)
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Pesky Furball,"Ay Revicecay Pikessay, leasepay."
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A Crevice Spike? Sure.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Pesky Furball,Ouyay nderstanduay emay?
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was a kid too.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Erehay.
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Pesky Furball,Hankstay!
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Erehay.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Pesky Furball,Erkjay...
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fuck you too... ay.
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You sure you didn't give me alcohol? I'm feeling dizzy.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe you're just drunk off the mood of the place?
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, that might be it."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You want anything else?
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, sure. Why not?"
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Alright, one more drink before we wrap things up."
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you want?
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm not picky. Give me anything.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Of course.
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Thanks.
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So... what exactly do you do? Sorry if it's rude to ask.
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I guess I am what people call an Office Boy.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"My duties usually involve looking for things, answering a few calls, that sort of stuff."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"But this being a dog-run company, there are a lot more responsibilities."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Like, getting stuff off of shelves and opening windows."
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,At least they pay well.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And how did you end up in that position? Where did you get that offer?
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"My neighbour is the owner of one of the dogs. He told me they needed ""thumbs""."
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Figures.
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They are celebrating the company's anniversary, right?"
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah. 5 years ago, three Corgis became dissatisfied with the quality of existing dog toys."
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,So they founded this company.
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"They got the money from their owners, if I remember correctly."
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I can see that happening... somehow.
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,The STC is the second biggest dog toy company in the world.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Fun fact: they started as Seifar Toy Development.
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ain't that unfortunate...
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Heeeeeeello~
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Hm?
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,The bar's favorite sweetheart has arrived!
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...why are you quiet?
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'm waiting for the audience's cheers to stop.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This isn't a sitcom.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Ah, honey, how innocent..."
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Um... excuse me, you are...?"
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I'm the lovely Dorothy Haze, at your ser-..."
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"WAIT! You're a Lilim. Not at your service, then..."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...?
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't be rude to other clients.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's kind of a regular here.
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"""Kind of""? I've been coming here religiously for the past three months now. THREE MONTHS."
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I come here to see your charming face and you say I'm just kind of"" a regular?"
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"For shame, honey. For shame!"
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm sorry... I guess.
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Nothing a free drink won't solve.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Won't do.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Huh? You playing hard to get?
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Even if I wanted to give you a drink, we're booked for the whole weekend."
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Don't you think you should at least put a sign out front or something?
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, I only found out myself just a few minutes ago."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,She can have one of my tickets if you're okay with it.
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see no problem.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, you're so sweet! If you were at least 40% organic, I would give you a discount."
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Discount?
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't need to know.
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, who booked you? This guy?"
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The Seifar Toy Company.
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,What do they do?
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,We... um... They create dog toys.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, lovely."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's also run by dogs.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, don't joke like that."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You think I'd kid about something like that?
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...y-you mean that if I turn around I'd s-s-see dogs?
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, didn't you see them when you came in?"
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I-I-I just entered without looking anywhere else but the bar!
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You look troubled.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I-I'm not too much of a dog p-p-person, I even charge extra if my clients want it doggy style..."
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Doggy...?
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't need to know.
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'm gonna take this ticket and trade it in next Monday. I'm leaving right n-now...
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The ticket would've expired by then though.
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,She looks like the kind of girl that will hold you to your promise regardless.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it that obvious?
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Well, I have to gather the cabs outside. Keep it up, bartender. Good night."
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, you too. Good night. Come again."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"All right, sirs. The night's over. You have kennels you need to return to!"
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,All done?
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, how do you end up being booked by dogs?"
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I know some dogs myself.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And you told me we're booked the whole weekend, right?"
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's right.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Please bear with it, we're all doing our part after all."
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I gotta go for today. Bye."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Take care.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Take care.
