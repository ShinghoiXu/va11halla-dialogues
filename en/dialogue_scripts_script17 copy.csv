2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hey.
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Okay, so... we've got almost everything, but we're still missing a couple of things for Saturday."
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"And so, I designate you, Gillian Applegate, as official ""Guy Who Goes To Buy The Rest of the Stuff."""
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Applegate?
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I have no idea who that is.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Why me?
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I could send Jill, but I wouldn't dare send a lady by herself."
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"And I could go with her, but I believe the bar should have at least two people in the vicinity at all times."
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"You're not gonna say anything, Jill?"
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If it means not being delivery girl, I'm happy to fake helplessness."
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,*sigh* Fine. Give me that list.
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I'll be back... sometime.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Something tells me you're planning something, Boss."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,What gives you that impression?
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Call it... a gut feeling.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Did you know Gil has a crush?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He... what?
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,A client of his. A girl that owns a bazaar.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,She's been coming on to him for ages and he's only just started opening up.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,But he's taking steps backward and I'm not gonna let him!
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"He's opening up, for fuck's sake."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And so the errands will take him to the bazaar, I take it."
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That's right!
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...huh.
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Alright then, to the office I go."
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(As for me...)
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Gil with a crush, huh.)"
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,This place... Great!
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, if it isn't..."
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, Jill! Sorry, but is there anywhere I can hide?"
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,There's an unpleasant guy on my trail.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss! Stalked woman incoming!
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The door's open!
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Go ahead, the door to the left."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Thanks!
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hello there!
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Oh, hi there!"
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The other one! That's the bathroom.
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Wait, what's the dog doing in the bathroom?)"
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Now, where did she..."
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh, the hell hole. Perfect."
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey kid, I'll have the usual."
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Huh, he remembered me after two weeks.)"
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,This seems right.
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Sure, good enough."
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Eh, whatever."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You know, kid, life after quitting has been quite nice."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I have enough money should I ever retire, but I can also do what I want."
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I could even start that hairdressing business like I've always wanted to.
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Should I say the newspaper is pretty much the same even without him?)
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Mr. Donovan. This is a stray thought, but..."
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you German by any chance?
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I wasn't born there, but I spent most of my life in Germany, yeah."
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Did something tip you off?
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well. When you came here a couple of weeks ago you mentioned that you do certain stuff while drunk.
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Speaking badly of your investors and... spouting racial slurs in German.
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The last one stuck with me, it felt... too random."
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Huh, I don't remember that."
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But yeah. I spent a good chunk of my life in Germany.
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,My pop was a car salesman and my mother an economy teacher.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(One mystery less)
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,The paper's been a mess lately.
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You'd think with all that's happening, they'd stay and do more reports."
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But they're all asking for vacations and I can't afford to be understaffed!
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,So I had to come up with some sort of reward for whoever produces the most reports.
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I see no difference in my feed, though.)"
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Mr. Donovan, I don't mean to sound rude, but..."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You do know the infamy of The Augmented Eye with the general public, right?"
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,A shitty page that will oversensationalize anything and report useless things.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Of course I know.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then why not try to rectify that image?
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,To put it simply: I'm being clutched by the balls... in the non-pleasant way.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Zaibatsu Corp. and company have an eye on every publication they haven't bought yet.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Report on them once and they'll find something to fine you with.
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Twice and you'll find your resources severely cut.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Anything beyond that and the best case scenario is that they'll buy the damn operation to keep it quiet.
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I know there are more newsworthy things than whatever it is the lackeys picked out that week.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"But if I overstep, my ass is on the line."
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Glad to see this hell hole is still in one piece.
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,The BTC has been going apeshit closing bars lately.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, that."
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yesterday, they closed one that served as a key part of a drug trafficking ring."
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"And last week, they closed three small bars that served as illegal chicken restaurants."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Not to mention, there are like a hundred people who have BTC certificates but never use them."
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Instead, they keep those credentials around to stop police from raiding their homes or warehouses."
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I don't know about you, but it's obvious to me that some restructuring will begin at the BTC after this whole thing."
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Man, shit ran deeper than I thought.)"
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...and no news outlet talks about that.)
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Alright kid, let's try a Moonblast now."
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...come again?
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey, even I have to break the routine from time to time."
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Now, let's see what the ruckus is about..."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Sure, I'll take this."
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And wrong!
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... so...
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What brought you here?
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh, right. Didn't you see a Lilim coming in here?"
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Blue hair, big tits."
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,She's the one from the encore concert coming up.
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not really.
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Did she jump to the roof then?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why were you looking for her?
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you want an interview?
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Not really. Just hitting on her.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey, I said hitting ON her, not hitting her! Stop glaring!"
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Why, though?"
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Are you that bored? Don't you have, like... a family or something?"
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Have you seen that girl? Hot as tits! Also, hot ass n' tits."
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm suffering the weirdest combo of being hard as fuck and curious as shit right now.
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I want to know just how detailed those King-Class CH1A models are. Personally.
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And so you followed her.
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I've yet to meet a woman that can resist the charms of Donovan D. Dawson.
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(You're in front of one. And I'm guessing you have quite the selective memory.)
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Like I said, don't you have a family or something?"
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"A wife, but that woman cheats on me as much as I cheat on her."
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"In fact, I'm pretty convinced she gets off on the thought of me cheating on her."
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So that Lilim isn't here, huh..."
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'll have to find a busty enough replacement tonight or I'll explode.
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey, after you're done glaring, please serve me a Piledriver."
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right.
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Alright.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,What? Did I do something to annoy you?
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Well, seeing as she's not here, I have no reason to stay."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Maybe I'll find someone that looks a bit like her...
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The guy left!
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Oh! Alright!
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Thanks for sheltering me, Dana. Hope your sister likes the video!"
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"No, thank you!"
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems you had a hearty talk.
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Your boss is such a fun person.
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Her sister is a fan of mine, so I recorded a small video for her and took a couple of photos."
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How nice of you.
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"It's nothing, really, and she did hide me, so it's the least I could do."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"But, well, we're here already. Mind giving me something sweet?"
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Thanks!
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Are you okay, Jill?"
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm? Yeah.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, do you know why Donovan was following you?"
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I don't, but I wasn't in the mood to deal with him."
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"His questions were a bit over the line last time, too."
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Not the worst I've dealt with, but I just didn't want to humor him."
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems like he was just trying to come onto you.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You don't say...
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, not like he'd have a chance anyways."
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I'm not into older guys and I'm already committed to a relationship.
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Figu-... wait, you are?"
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"It's not common knowledge and the ones that hear it try to dismiss it as rumors, but..."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I've been in a relationship with my producer for a while now.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"We were both single, and that kind of stuff is bound to happen when you spend so much time together."
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,But it all started when he read an entry I made in my blog about wanting to experience love and the like.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"He offered to ""help with that"" after he read it and I thought ""sure, why not?"""
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I already knew him well enough, it wouldn't hurt to try!"
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How nice.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"He's a stick in the mud where planning is due, but he's a sweetheart otherwise."
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know, I've met two fans of yours lately."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Really?!
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Both of them seemed so excited when they were talking about you. It was amazing.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Heheheh...
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I don't like the term ""fan"" too much. It strikes me as a bit... pretentious, in my opinion."
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"""I have many fans"" doesn't sit so well. I like ""many people who like my music"" better."
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"""Fan"" evokes an uglier and more pretentious image for me."
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"...do you like what I do, Jill? Do you like my music?"
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"To be honest, I haven't had much exposure to your work, but..."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The few things I've heard are really good.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And, not gonna lie, having talked to you, I feel like I would support you even if I didn't like it."
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,So nice to hear!
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, can you really walk so calmly? These streets aren't exactly... safe."
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Really? I haven't faced any issues lately.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Sure, they've tried to mug me once or twice, but it's no big deal."
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No big deal?
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Every time someone tries to mug me, somebody pops out of... somewhere and stops it."
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Makes me feel like I'm always protected.
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Those are some hardcore stalkers.)
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I guess the fact that she ran away from Donovan, even after all that, says something.)"
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey, this will sound familiar, but do you have anything like tea?"
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let me see...
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Perfect!
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Yeah, this works."
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Too vague of an order, huh?"
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry.
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, you're a King-Class CH1A, right?"
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"That, I am."
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,May I ask you something about your model?
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Sure!
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are there any differences between you and a DFC-72?
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Hm...
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"We both serve the same purpose, but..."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"DFC-72s have the port on their heads, which makes them more versatile."
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"My line lacks that or the resilience of the DT-01Ds, but we're a tad more polished elsewhere."
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"More specifically, our voice emulators are more advanced and our movements are smoother."
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"A trade off of functionality and power for appearance, you could say."
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hey Jill, will you go to my next concert?"
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I heard every ticket was sold out. Never mind how expensive they are.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So I guess that's a no, sorry."
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Now you will!
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Here!
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Eh?!
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is... Is this...?
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It's a ticket for my encore concert!
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Sorry it's not a better seat, but I only get so many free tickets."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"N-No! I mean, this is amazing!"
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know if I can accept it, though."
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You will. It even has a backstage pass so we can talk afterward and you'll tell me how it was!
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why give it to me?
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"I don't know, I like you."
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,You're attentive and hear me out. That behaviour should be rewarded more.
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well... thanks!
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"God, it feels so weird to get a gift."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And from a celebrity no less!
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Don't think too much about it. You deserve it.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Although I guess I can understand how you feel about receiving gifts.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I usually get quite a few from fans but it always feels so... weird.
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I don't like feeling as though I got something for free.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Luckily, I've thought of a way of not feeling so bad about it."
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How?
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Just give it my all on stage!
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,They gave those gifts to me after watching me perform.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,It's only natural for me to do my best and give it my all as a way to repay them.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I should... uh... give it my all mixing drinks, then?"
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Of course!
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... I see.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, anything new for this concert?"
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Hm... well, it is an encore, so we're trying to make it the same for those that couldn't go to the first one."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"But we always try to spice it up, like maybe with a surprise song or something."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,There was this one time I sang a cover of a song by b-LINK.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Of course, in return, they sang Your Love is a Drug."
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah.
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So you know the b-LINK girls?
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Really nice kids. You'd be surprised how different from their onstage personas they are.
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really?
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Suzu, for example, can be really childish at times. She also laughs a lot... and loudly at that."
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Meanwhile, Aina is a party girl through and through."
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"If they're not on tour, she spends her time partying like crazy."
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, hard to believe. I mean, their image is that of stoic girls with little expression."
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Almost like living Victorian dolls or something.
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, they wanted to pop out in the public."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"They once told me, ""If we want people to notice us, we have to break the cutesy idol concept."""
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And so they took the opposite route by becoming ""cool beauties"" with melancholic songs?"
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,I wouldn't say they went the opposite way.
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"The opposite of cutesy idols would be unkempt, tone-deaf girls spewing vitriol and hate."
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"True, I guess."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, I've gotta go, but let's have a Sparkle Star first."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Sparkling!
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,This isn't as shiny as I expected.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,"Well, it's always a pleasure, Jill."
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Will do!
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,*Kira* Miki,Oh! The handsome bartender! Nice to see you!
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Um? Uh...
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss! Gil's back, I'll take my break."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alright, then..."
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, you're in my spot. Please."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, sorry."
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Also, you're cleaning one of Boss' chicken buckets."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...did Boss ask you to do that?
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"...if I told you she did, would you believe me?"
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Without a doubt.
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Let's go with that, then."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Greetings.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Stella. What can I get you?"
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'll go with a Bleeding Jane today.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thank you.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...right.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What brought you here today? Waiting for Sei?
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I came by myself, actually. I was in the area and stopped to say hi."
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's pretty interesting, though. When I first saw you, I doubted you'd ever come here again."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, this place is... comfortable, I must admit."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,So quiet and secluded.
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's also clean, really clean."
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gil is the one you can owe that to.
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The guy takes pride in how clean he keeps things around here.
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you ever need cleaning staff, he's a nice pick."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Really?
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Hm... hmhmhm...
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"He's a bit out of it today, though."
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I see.
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hey Jill, have you heard of the new gold rush in the city?"
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gold rush?
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Everyone is paying small fortunes to get their hands on pieces of White Knight suits.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I think I heard or read something about that? But I'm having doubts, so probably not."
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In any case, how is it a gold rush?"
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, the tech behind the suits was always safely guarded, but after the events at the bank..."
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...sorry.
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"After the events at the bank, the suits were remotely shut down, bricking many of them in the process."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Many units dropped their armor right there and fled when the lynchings went on.
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Any White Knight still stuck in their suit had to take the armor off manually to run away.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It all happened in the middle of the lynchings, so they'd be sitting ducks if they didn't."
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Some weren't that lucky. They got beaten up while they weren't able to move.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"So, between the suits becoming glorified paperweights, and many White Knights going on the run..."
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,There ended up being a lot of junk lying around.
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But the whole scientific community is rejoicing.
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They're on a race to reverse-engineer the suits and take as much technology as possible from them.
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"And of course, even single pieces of the armor fetch a high price these days."
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Could anyone see any profit from that research to justify those expenses?
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's new tech, a whole new field ripe with patents just opened for many. So I'd say yes."
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, the BTC is literally a conglomerate built upon patents and trademarks, I can see how."
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,There is one weird case though...
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,There's this guy named Jack. He's the captain of a very unique Blitzkrieg Corps unit.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Unique?
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"The guy had a really small unit. Five people, including himself."
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The aesthetics of his unit's armor was heavily modded to the point that they looked like a squad of Henshin Heroes.
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hen what?
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*ahem* They looked really gaudy.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But it turned out that the guy actually broke through the software and disabled the remote switch.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He has one of the few - if not the only - suits of armor with the OS intact.
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,To say they're among the most wanted people would be an understandment.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know a lot about this.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's interesting, the amount of things you hear when dealing with drunk people of all kinds in the same place."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It also helps to put on a front that makes people lower their guard...
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,That should sound familiar to you.
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,True.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...wait.
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Here's a freebie. A fun fact.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,The failsafe was originally going to involve the armor blowing up and leaving no traces.
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But regulations and laws didn't allow that kind of technology near civilians.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I guess even Zaibatsu Corp has its limits, huh."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"People love to demonize Zaibatsu Corp. because, let's face it, they're far from innocent."
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"But they're not evil overlords, they're just... greedy. They're just a big corporation."
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They just so happen to have control over what tantamounts to a city-state.
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But corporations will naturally resort to draconian methods.
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I've heard horror stories from people outside the city about trying to use product placement.
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"If you so much as hold a bottle the wrong way or get in the way of a logo, you'll be in for lots of trouble."
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And let's not start with theme parks or the like. Those are dystopias of their own.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Then again, most of the ""demonization"" is due to QUINCY being such a clown."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He has no power anyways.
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He's just the front that whatever council behind Zaibatsu Corp. chose.
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He makes a fool of himself and the attention is taken away from whatever it is that Zaibatsu Corp is actually doing.
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Yeah.
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So what you were saying is that Glitch City is basically a huge theme park?
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I've called the White Knights ""Glorified Mall Security"" in the past, so yeah."
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...no, seriously. Hen what?"
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*ahem*
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"C-Can I get a Brandtini here, please?"
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, sure."
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thanks.
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I take it you're in a good mood today?
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Does it show?
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bit.
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, well..."
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I managed to nab a couple of tickets for the *Kira* Miki encore concert.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nice.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh right, as it turns out she was just here."
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,AGAIN?!
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*ahem* Sorry.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Again?
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Can't believe I just missed her.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I was surprised too. I was more surprised she remembered my name, though."
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And, like last time, she was quite the graceful client."
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Man, so those rumors about her being really nice in person were actually true? Amazing."
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I know, she even got me a ticket for the concert."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,She WHAT?!
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I had to twist some arms to get tickets for the encore concert...
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"And not only did you get them free, the idol herself gave them to you?!"
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Do you have any idea how jealous I am right now?
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It'll be interesting.
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You're gonna enjoy the hell out of it. Trust me.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"This will be my first live concert of her, but I've seen every other concert of hers on video."
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They all have such a magical aura to them.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Everyone says they have to be seen to be believed.
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You really like her music, huh?"
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It makes me happy. What can I say?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I love listening to it when I'm feeling down.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hell, it even helped me when I was worried sick about Sei at the bank."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It made me forget all my worries, even if for a while."
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, I see."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Say, Jill, you wanna come to the concert with us?"
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Us""?"
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I invited Sei because I managed to get two tickets. You wanna come with us both?
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'd love to. I didn't want to go by myself, but..."
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are you okay with that? I don't wanna be a burden.
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Of course! The more the merrier!
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I mean, you always want the famous people to be nice in real life..."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"But having such backing to that claim, to hear that she's so nice to everyone..."
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It's nice to hear, you know?"
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"In fact, many think that's what made her so famous so quickly."
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"How she's down to earth and totally accessible, making her someone everyone wants to root for."
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, I see."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I mean, I guess you don't want to feel like you're supporting crappy people."
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although to be honest, I've never put much thought into that one."
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hell, half the time I have no idea who made what I use, nor do I care much."
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Being a nice person will take you far, though."
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"My daddy always insisted that ""being ruthless in the boardroom doesn't mean being an ass""."
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And he has actually managed to get certain contracts over other more powerful people.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,All thanks to being a nice guy overall.
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds like good advice.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But more importantly, ""daddy""?"
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...*ahem*
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you really believe me saying she was just here that easily?
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You're not the kind to lie about stuff like that, so sure."
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thanks, I guess."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That said, can you go to the concert so easily? What about security and the like?"
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,My dad always has a unit keeping an eye on me from a distance.
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And you'd be surprised at how easily I can disguise myself with just a different hairdo and a cap.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I wonder if I could get in the disabled line with Sei and her wounds...
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Although she'll probably nag me about how she doesn't need it and we shouldn't abuse that.
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hey, can you get me a classic drink?"
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thank you.
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,This is classic how?
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Eh, whatever."
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think you should know about this...
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,About what?
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sei... um... told me about your eye.
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"That? Oh yeah, I knew."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You did?
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sei told me. I'm alright. Don't worry.
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Still... that was quite the... um...
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, damn..."
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,We all have our own share of painful stories. I might be just as shocked hearing something from you.
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I've gotten over it, but every time someone brings attention to my eye, it... starts hurting."
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"The tech in the replacement is good enough, but remembering it hurts a bit."
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Still, she also told you about that... Virgilio guy, didn't she?"
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know him?
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Virgilio Armandio didn't net any results but after digging deeper, we found another name."
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Timothy Mercury. Branded traitor after killing a fellow White Knight. Declared MIA.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Seems like the guy knew how to hide himself.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you gonna do?
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"At the very least, seek him to thank him. It's the least I can do."
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you have many servants around the house, Stella?"
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I do, but they've been with us for so long, they're pretty much family."
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"My dad has always said that if you earn someone's trust, they'll gleefully work for you, and everyone wins."
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,We even had a young gardener that left to study engineering. And he actually came back!
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,He still comes by every weekend to tend the plants.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Man, that sounds nice."
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Let me know if you're ever in need of a job, I might find you something."
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks for the offer.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...wait.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Hm?
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I just realized something's off with the whole tech gold rush story.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,What would it be?
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wouldn't all that tech be patented anyways? I get trying to crack it in the first place, but..."
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,That would be true if the tech was patented in the first place.
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It isn't?
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Zaibatsu have been so paranoid about making the White Knights untouchable that they never patented anything.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,A patent would be in a database that someone could hack and retrieve valuable info from.
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Not to mention they've been using tech from other companies without any authorization.
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And no patent registry in their right mind would approve of that global shutdown signal.
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Let alone how it immobilized everyone still inside one of those suits.
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So the ones that were upholding the law did so using suits that are by all means illegal?
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"The irony runs deep, wouldn't you say?"
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do it though?
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"When you have so much money, you start thinking you can screw around with the rules."
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,All that power makes you think you're above every law there is.
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And this city is what happens when those with money start making the rules.
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm curious though, have you ever covered up any fuck ups by using money?"
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...I think we've all done things we're not too proud of at some point of our lives.
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Well, Jill. I gotta go. Always a pleasure."
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Excuse me, is this the... ""Rad Shiba Bar""?"
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Hello?
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Somebody fell for that one.)
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but we prefer to call it Valhalla."
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Let's try the Sugar Rush.
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Certainly.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Thanks!
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,This doesn't seem right.
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You don't look like you're from around here, miss..."
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Call me Jess.
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"I'm from Neo-San Francisco, actually. I came here to see the Mega Christmas I hear so much about."
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've always wondered why it's called Neo-San Francisco.
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is it like Neo-Tijuana? Or is it more like New Mexico?
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Wait, there's a New Mexico?"
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Still, that's... a good question."
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,What tipped you off that I'm not from around here?
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The fact that you're a hybrid.
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Really? I thought Glitch City was the ""world's genetic engineering mecca""."
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Every time you hear about a breakthrough in genetic engineering, it most likely came from here."
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That's true, that's all true. If you have the money."
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Glitch City has some awesome advances, but many of them are gated behind giant walls of cash."
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Like genetic modifications or prosthetics.
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Is it really that bad?
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's say I wanted a treatment to change my hair color to yellow and my eyes to amber.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Simple stuff. Two shots.
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But just for the hair, I'd need to save minimum wage paychecks for 10 years."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not only that, insurers still refuse to cover genetic modifications. Even the medical ones."
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Weird. I mean...
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Nowadays, genetic modifications are pretty common everywhere else."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't understand much about it myself.
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think the exorbitant import fees levied by the city are a deciding factor in the whole pricing situation.
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Or maybe it has to do with how devaluated our currency is. Or maybe it's both those things and then some.
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,I see.
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, but look at me rambling. Can I get you anything else?"
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Hm... let's try the Brandtini.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Thanks.
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Something's off on this one.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's interesting, though. hybrids are well received around here."
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It might have something to do with hybrids usually having lots of money.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess it could be an example of the higher classes establishing beauty standards or something.
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"It will make me a more likely target for mugging, then."
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Everyone is a likely target for mugging. You'd just stick out a bit more than the rest.
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You'd do well to remain vigilant anyways.
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Thanks for the advice.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, mind if I ask something?"
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Go ahead, no problem."
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are Cat Boomers hybrids?
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Hm...
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Nah, I don't think so."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"While there is genetic modification going on, it's more akin to being born with six fingers."
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"The side effect of a treatment, if you will."
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Really? Because there seem to be countries where Cat Boomers are considered hybrids.
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"True, but think about it for a second."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Let's say you got a treatment for a skin condition, and the side effect was getting scaly skin."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"There's hybrids with scales as skin, but your skin is a side effect, the scales might just be dead skin."
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Even if legally the scaly skin could make you a hybrid, you're not one necessarily."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Even if it's a law, laws can be wrong too."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, you're right. Sorry about asking so many things."
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,"Oh, I don't mind. I guess you really don't see many hybrids around, huh?"
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Oh! Right. Could you give me directions to the Artemis Will Mall?
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sure, let me grab a piece of paper."
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see...
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...turn right... when you see a frat house...
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Thanks a lot.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jess,Goodbye!
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,All done?
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I am, what about you, Gil?"
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For some reason, the idol girl left him like that, it seems."
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You think?
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,It might've been while he was out.
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,True.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Boss. You're a fan of wrestling, aren't you? I mean, you WERE a wrestler, so..."
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"That I am, yeah. Why?"
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I was wondering. Isn't wrestling fake?
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Aren't twintails for little girls and teens with eighth grade syndrome?
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eighth grade what?
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"When you get down to it, wrestling is as real as a soap opera."
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I mean, you don't really expect a legal lawsuit to be fixed in a ring, right?"
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"...sure, in my ideal world, you would solve legal problems through good ol' wrestling but..."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,*ahem*
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, seriously. Eighth grade what?"
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,But you don't go around calling soap operas fake.
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"It's a show, it just so happens to use fights as an expression."
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You might as well see it as an unique form of theater.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Besides, considering the injuries many wrestlers suffer, it's not all fake."
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Huh, I didn't think about it that way."
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Sadly, I won't stand for anyone badmouthing wrestling."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,So now I have to go and break Gil's back to make you humble.
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh well-... wait, what?"
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,C'MERE FUCKBOY!!!
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,FuckboAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...eighth grade what?
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Note to self: buy oil for that door.
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Alma."
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...no ""hello""?"
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You're pretty insistent on that one, aren't you?"
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's basic courtesy. Something I WILL fight to uphold.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"First the greetings stop, then saying ""Please"" and ""Thanks"" stops. And before you know it, BOOM! Total anarchy!"
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're exaggerating.
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Am not.
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"In fact, I'll go through that door again, and I expect you to properly greet me this time."
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Fine.
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hello, Jill."
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary..."
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...?
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping."
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door."
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door. Only this and nothing more."""
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...you overdid it. You totally overdid it.
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Quoth the Bartender, ""I did not""."
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, you like poetry?"
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I had a phase.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can I get you something?
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's start with a big Cobalt Velvet.
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Thanks.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Um... sure, let's go with this."
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Wrong drink, Jill."
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh yeah, there's something I've been wondering about for a while."
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Does the name ""Shadowmaster69's Chronicles"" ring any bells?"
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...!
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Wow, you went pale."
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,N-No... the name doesn't ring any bells.
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""May 22nd. Today my daily card readings told me that I'd meet great change, thanks to an old man""."
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""My biology teacher told me I had been picked for an inter-school contest with my latest essay."""
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""I just knew 'A Scientific Theory on the Idea of Auras' was as revolutionary as I thought!"""
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""Soon I'll bring the world into the occult-science singularity!"""
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Later entries don't seem to have gone that well, though."
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Mentions of being laughed at, being lectured on why the essay was wrong..."
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Jill?
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I MADE SURE TO DELETE THAT BLOG! NO EVIDENCE SHOULD BE LEFT!!
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I can think of at least six different sources off the top of my head that have all that stuff archived.
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why?! W-Why?!
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sheesh, relax. It's not that bad."
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you mean it's not that bad?! Don't you realize how embarrassing it all is?!
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"We've all been young, Jill. Relax."
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's not like you're still like that nowadays. THAT would've been embarrassing.
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...you're not still like that, right?"
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gods no, I gave up on the whole occult stuff."
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's just that remembering all that stuff is...
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*BRRRRRRRRR*
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I don't know. I like the way you looked.
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"All dressed in black, with the rare accessory popping out, thanks to the colors."
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, at least you had the decency to use makeup and take care of yourself."
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...so you have a pic.
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh god, you have a fucking pic."
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why do you do this to me? Why do you dig out the sins of my past?
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I was bored.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Last Friday, I had to take my mind off the whole Dayana thing so I ran a small background check on you."
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Simple stuff, just checking past internet activity."
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please don't run background checks like that.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I just used a search engine, you know? I didn't request documents or anything."
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What led you to the page?
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You do realize your main mail account everywhere is still the one you used back then, right?"
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Like I said, relax."
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You were obsessed with occultism, I wanted to kiss all the boys..."
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...and I kinda almost accomplished that in middle school, which still sort of haunts me today."
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh* Never underestimate the lengths old classmates will go to track you down.
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Especially if they think you're still the girl that kissed them for fun and they're lonely to boot.
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,We all have things we're not too proud of as adults.
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh* Now I know how criminals feel when evidence is used against them.
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I have to ask, though, why the 69?"
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...it was supposed to be six-nine, not sixty-nine. Like, in reference to both The Lovers and The Hermit."
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I was convinced it meant ""Wise Choices""."
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jill, there's NOBODY that would read that as Six-Nine."
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I was twelve at the time...
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Even at twelve, I fucking knew what a sixty-nine was. Just how innocent were you back then?"
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...you have no idea.
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, let's sweeten up things a bit. I'll have a Sugar Rush."
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is the thing.
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is not the thing.
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, Alma, speaking of the past. What was your last long-term relationship like?"
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That's sudden.
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You dug through my past, I've earned the right to dig through yours."
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Fine, fine..."
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Long lasting relationships, huh..."
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Romantic ones, I'm guessing."
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yup.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm...
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, I've had about... four boyfriends who I'd describe as such. That I've introduced to my family and all."
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The first one was in high school. I broke up with him because he cheated on me.
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I remember the other girl trying to pick a fight, and me just saying ""keep the fucker""."
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The second one was during my freshman year.
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I broke up with him after he thought it'd be funny to punch me in the arm.
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He starts with a friendly hit and before you know it...
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...anyways.
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The other guy, I met shortly after I dropped out."
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"He was interested in marriage, but he wanted to get married after only half a year or so of knowing him."
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...and then there's Richard.
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I spent almost 4 years with him.
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"We got along pretty well, we had awesome chemistry, I... truly loved him."
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But as time went by, there was a rift that started separating us."
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He just didn't like my family.
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He didn't?
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Moreover, he wasn't a family person. He distanced himself from his own and voiced that he didn't want kids."
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"There was a part of me that wanted to believe, even if just for a little bit, that maybe he'd change his mind."
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But as much as I loved him, that one detail brought a growing gap between us."
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And at one point I just... had to break up with him.
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But I'm not here to depress you. Bring me a Beer, will ya?"
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Thanks for telling me that, by the way."
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Don't mention it.
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Don't tell me the tale distressed you.
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Kinda?
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay, one more question and we're even."
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Wow, you really are embarrassed of that blog, huh?"
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, ask away."
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,At what age did you get those implants in your boobs?
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jill, I love you and I know you're saying that in jest..."
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But I've lived through so many rumors about me getting plastic surgery that I can't and won't take it as a joke.
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"As such, and honoring our friendship, I'll just say this..."
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"They're real, and they're spectacular."
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Now ask the real question before I slap you.
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'll grant you one, and only one chance to call me by my full name as a compensation, then."
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I gladly take your offer.
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's funny that you mention slapping because my real question was, why did you get your hands chopped?"
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Heheh... chopped.
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, there's a couple of reasons."
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The first is that I spend lots of time typing, and these replacements help me avoid Carpal Tunnel Syndrome."
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There's other utilities. Like how I can interface with many devices.
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"For example, there's a tiny computer embedded in my glasses."
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If I move my index finger, it acts like the computer's cursor."
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"There's lots more, but they're small things that don't sound that impressive when I say it out loud."
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How did your family take the operation?
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They took it well enough... except for my mom. She freaked out for months.
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She even went to the hospital to ask for my hands.
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't you miss them?
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sometimes, but just during emotional moments. But as luck would have it, someone else has them."
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Shortly before my operation, there was an accident on the highway."
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,One of the victims was this young lady whose right hand got completely crushed.
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I told them to check if we were compatible and all that.
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, implants are not everyone's first choice if they can get a natural replacement."
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A bit of cosmetic treatment and it could pass off as her original hand with no problem.
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Last I heard we were compatible and the family agreed to the donation.
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't know what became of her, but I hope she's fine."
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you didn't tell your mom about that?
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I didn't want her pestering the poor girl.
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, are we cool now? Are we even now?"
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Are we? You were pretty pissed about my comment regarding your boobs.
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Again, I'm sorry. It sounded a lot less rude in my head."
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, don't worry about that."
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Besides, I get to call you Julianne once."
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Now you don't.
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Eh? Why?
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You just called me by my full name.
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...are you serious?
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"One chance and only one chance, and you just used it up."
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Dammit!
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Surprise!
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Alma, this might be a weird tangent, but... do you believe in ghosts?"
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Hey!
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Not particularly, no."
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Although there was this paper I read once that was quite interesting.
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It proposed a scenario where nanomachine clusters would leave the body after death.
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And then acted as a collective hivemind through residual brain waves.
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The result would basically be an image not unlike a hologram.
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Of course, the hypothesis fell through because such nanomachine density is imposible in a body."
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Even 5% of the amount needed is enough to make the blood too dense for the heart.
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And it's not like brain waves are potent enough to create those reactions.
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Still an interesting read, though."
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Anna,Don't give me that look. It's not my fault that you convinced yourself that you're crazy.
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, I'll leave then. See ya tomorrow."
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,See ya.
