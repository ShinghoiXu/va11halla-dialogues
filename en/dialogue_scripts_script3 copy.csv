2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Oh, hi there!"
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I was expecting the bar to be... different before opening hours, but I guess it's just the same tired thing."
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alma?
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Ah, Leonidas."
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Gillian.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Marcelo.
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I stumbled across her on my way in and asked her if she wanted to tag along.
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hope you don't mind.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Sure. Make yourself at home.
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Where's Boss? She didn't put the helmet on again, did she?"
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"She went out for a bit. I don't know what for, but she'll be back."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alma, make yourself comfortable while I prepare."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Right, thanks."
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What was that?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh, just something they made me say back in Instruction. It kind of stuck."
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Huh...
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I went to a school that made us stand up with our hands on our backs when someone came in.
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That habit didn't rub off until high school or so.
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, it's kinda like that."
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, look at this."
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A glass with a signature?
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,To Ji... Jiiii... um...
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll assume it's either an autograph or an impromptu medicine recipe.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That *Kira* Miki girl came here yesterday before her concert, actually."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, yeah. Now I see her name here."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't seem very surprised.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I like b-LINK more, actually."
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The stoic-looking duo, right?"
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yup, those."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh* Seems you had a better day than mine yesterday. I had to break up with Damian.
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see. Want a drink?
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You... don't seem very surprised.
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alma, we've known each other for... what? A few months now?"
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'd be interested if those ""relationships"" of yours went further than a week or two."
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You say you broke up, but there's usually not enough time to foster something to break."
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's more like... ""The guy wasn't what I wanted so I stopped flirting."""
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...you could pretend to be more interested, you know?"
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Like my mom says: ""If I don't buy it, it's because I know the product""."
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Speaking of buying, do you want a frame?"
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A frame?
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, for all these pics you have of your Boss. The ones filling your phone's memory."
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Some seem sneakily taken at that.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Is that true?
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you care?
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How the hell did you find that out?
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,So it IS true!
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up!
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I'm a hacker, remember? You shouldn't piss off a hacker."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Aw, I really like this one of her sleeping in her office. I think I'll copy it."
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You...!
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, can you make me a Bad Touch before we keep arguing?"
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfft*... Sure.
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Who gives these drinks their silly names?
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Usually the one who registers it.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Some people have quite the silly sense of humor.
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Like that girl who keeps laughing over this particular drink's name?
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, yeah..."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is one big ba-...
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Are you hitting on me?
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You wish.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is a phrase I'd hoped to never use in my life but...
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"This isn't a Bad Touch, Jill."
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You didn't give me a Bad Touch.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You failed at giving me a Bad Touch.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*pfffft* S-S-S-Sttttop...
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem* So. Who's Damian again?
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The one with the nice car.
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, he's also the manager at the bank, but that car was what caught my eye."
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And what was wrong with him?
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Turns out he was a LARPer.
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,LARP?
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Live Action Role Playing.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds more like the nickname of some very heavy-handed writer. Or a military organization.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What did he roleplay as?
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Have you heard of the Woodstock fairs?
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Those events where people barely dress, stink, roll in the mud, and fuck in the open?"
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Those are hippies, yeah."
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He frequents those and... it's something I'd rather not deal with. At all.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If I stayed with him, I'd eventually have to."
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, I need to support my partner in what he does, but if it's something like that..."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You see? That's the problem right there.
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You say breaking up like you had something formal, but most of the time you're still getting to know him."
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Think about it. Have you ended your longest lasting relationships for things like those?
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Okay, sorry for not using the right word or whatever. But I'm still sorely  disappointed."
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And at least I'm trying to get some action. When was the last time you spent the night with someone else?
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Last night.
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Your cat doesn't count.
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A year ago. It was messy.
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,See?
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, I have no idea how you deal with that."
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If I were you, I would've pushed fuckboy over there into a closet ages ago."
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,F-Fuckboy?
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,People have different needs and priorities.
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yes, but don't you miss having the warmth of someone else at your side?"
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Using them as a pillow, mixing your perfume with theirs."
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Putting your head on their chest, listening to them breathe as they pet your head."
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Dozing off knowing they're there, watching you. Protecting you..."
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Jill?
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anything I can make you to shut up and drink?
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll have you know that my uncle Juan taught me ventriloquism when I was 12.
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Drinking won't stop me from talking... or making tasteless puns for aunt Rosa.
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Still, get me something weird, would you?"
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Huh, ventriloquism.)"
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Weird? A weird drink?
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, something different, experimental, uncommon..."
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Let's see...
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, this fits the bill."
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's a promotional drink made to commemorate a movie.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Read, ""they leapt at the chance to sell drinks that would be unmarketable otherwise""."
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh...
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Nope, this looks pretty common to me."
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I'll take it anyways, but no tip for this one."
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know, your orders are weird today."
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They are?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, usually the first thing you ask for is a Brandtini. And then something like a Cobalt Velvet or something similar."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, I sometimes feel like I need something different, you know?"
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Something tells me part of the reason you left this Damian is because he was too deep into routine.
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...maybe.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, speaking of routines..."
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"As a hacker, what's your opinion on the whole Alice_Rabbit thing?"
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's the silence of somebody who just heard something stupid.
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Stupid enough to warrant the speech they've prepared just for occasions like this.
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"As always, very perceptive of you."
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You know, decades ago, there was this group of people that hacked simple sites with an ""agenda""."
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Can't remember what they used to call themselves. I just remember that it was just petty vandalism.
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anyway, everyone that participated started using the same name."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They wanted to create this... anonymous anarchists identity.
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The whole Alice_Rabbit thing is the logical conclusion of that.
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's what happens when that idea reaches its breaking point and goes mainstream.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It is no longer a group, but an individual."
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"An untouchable entity watching from the shadows, monitoring and judging everything anyone does..."
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Observing, tolerating no one but itself..."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A lot of bullshit for what's essentially a pet the press made up.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The antithesis of your usual bogeyman, if you must."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, you don't think such a person exists?"
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Don't know, don't care."
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, we HAVE seen the actions of such an entity."
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But it might be anything. An individual, a group, an AI..."
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That's not taking into account all the copycats and pranksters using the name.
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, Alice_Rabbit is a thing that exists, but it's also really muddied overall."
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"There's something else that worries me, though."
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That kind of story always catches the attention of kids and such.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They start trying to hack stuff without knowing the risks or consequences.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Imagine if, suddenly, a group of tweens broke into this bar and started asking for drinks."
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"That's how it feels for me, and it's thanks to that damned Alice_Rabbit thing."
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"But enough of that, there's a more pressing matter at hand."
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There is?
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, you've been delaying my invitations for hanging out sometime for too long!"
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... that.
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Do you hate me that much, Jill? Does my presence make you that uncomfortable?"
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, I..."
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,At this rate I might just crash by your apartment! That way you can't just say no.
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Maybe I'll also crash for the night.
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"We could have a sleepover, braid our hair, tell stories all night, shower together..."
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You know you need some human warmth in that place.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your tits alone would fill my entire bathroom.
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Man, you react too nonchalantly. It's no fun."
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,React a little bit. Let me tease you for a second.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I refuse.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"In all seriousness, though. Any particular reason you keep turning down my invitations?"
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, it's not a date. I just wanna have a conversation with you outside these four walls."
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm... not a morning person.
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I registered for a night shift precisely to avoid waking up early.
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"The earliest I've asked you out is 10 a.m, you know?"
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's early morning by my standards.
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I mean, it's not that I don't wanna hang out. I just don't want to wake up early."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You. Are. Hopeless.
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anyway, I'm gonna need another drink here."
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Like, say... a big Brandtini."
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Finally. That's the Alma I know.
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You know, Brandtini is such a weird name..."
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It was originally supposed to replicate the Martini.
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Problem is, the BTC got a hold of a brand of vermouth that was named after a certain automobile company."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, on a weird whim, they changed the name."
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I see.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jill, do you advocate that bullshit about size not mattering?"
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Because this better be some concentrated shit to justify its teeny size.
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What's this?
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A Brandford. A blended Brandtini, so to speak."
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I studied with a girl with the surname Brandford in high school. Tina, I think."
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Alright, let's give this a try."
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm... pretty good.
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Wrong!
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Come on, girl! I know you can do better than this!"
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Jill...
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,J... i... l... l...
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That'd be 4a 69 6c 6c.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Or 01001010 01101001 01101100 01101100.
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"In binary, you have fifteen 1's..."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Did you celebrate your quince... quin... your fifteenth birthday party? Eh Jill?
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't think so.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What about your sweet sixteen? Did you do anything special for that?
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nope.
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And your eighteenth? Or twenty first?
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, none of those. I saw no point in making them any different from other birthdays."
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, but they're different."
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They celebrate your budding sexuality.
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's the point where society tells you that you can fuck.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That you're starting to look appealing enough for other people to consider fucking you.
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"It's also the hypocritical way they tell you ""You can, but SHOULDN'T fuck""."
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess that's one way of seeing it.
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Although there's no point in celebrating those so late.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There was this one time in middle school where I got fed up with a teacher.
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I was in eighth grade, but the idiot kept treating me like a child."
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, one day, I adjusted my shirt, pushed my boobs together with my arms, and told him:"
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""Teacher, you do know you could get me pregnant, right?"""
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Poor bastard couldn't look at me for the rest of the year.
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I also got suspended, scolded and grounded. But it was totally worth it!"
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I was a blossoming woman and I wasn't gonna stand for it!
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This is why I like numbers.
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Numbers don't await your sexual awakening just to tell you later that you shouldn't be sexual.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Numbers never betray you. They don't cross you.
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They don't expect you to form a family or give them grandkids...
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You think a 27 cares if you have a Catholic wedding?
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, but I care that you're drunk."
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I am most certainly not.
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Then spell your name.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,41... 6c... 6d... 61. There!
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not in Hexadecimal.
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A... elle... muh...
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll call you a cab.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll be fine. I'm going home now.
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,My brother in law is close by. He told me to call him when I was done.
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Bye, Jill."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care out there.
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know, I was wondering..."
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Yeah?
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't you worry about what the people you work for might be doing with the information you provide?
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Not really.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You don't?
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Do you worry about what happens when people leave this place drunk?
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Not really... most of the time.
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, neither do I."
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why should you? Do you get people drunk?
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Some say my beauty is intoxicating, but that's besides the point."
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I get my payment, do my job, and forget about the whole thing."
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You make your job sound so easy...
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Once you understand what precautions to take, it's no problem. And I've always found my job fun."
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"However, most of my contracts are consultancy-based gigs. It's not like every day's a thrill."
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you meet with your client or...?
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I don't. It's always from behind as many filters as I can manage.
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I remember I once did a job where I had a couple of kids relaying letters.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For security reasons, right?"
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Actually, because that way I lose a lot less time."
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I don't have to deal with clients hitting on me or pestering me after the job's done...
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I also don't have to lose time proving my worth because big boobs equals small brain or some shit like that.
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, protecting my identity is one of the reasons. But the few times I've shown myself..."
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh*
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"They weren't even risky or dangerous jobs, just run-of-the-mill security checks."
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't know, maybe I need to show up as a disheveled nerd or something. Give them what they expect to see."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...or I just don't show up and save myself the trouble.
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Why all the questions?
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just things I've been curious about and always forget to ask.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So many Alice_Rabbit headlines have made me wonder about the hacking business too.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh. I'll remember to ask you things next time then.
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, I'll take my leave now. See ya!"
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Hello sugar.
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Ow!
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...hello, Mr. Donovan."
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Like my pop used to say, never touch the ass of a woman with metallic arms."
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think it's more like plastic and carbon fiber.
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They're hard as fuck and that's all my abdomen felt.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you normally... greet people that way?
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I'm a man that can't contain himself when he sees something he likes, kid."
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh, but don't worry. You're safe. You're flatter than the field at my summer house."
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A bit of advice. You shouldn't provoke the ones serving you drinks or food.
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Don't be offended, kid. You have your audience. I'm just not part of it."
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Today I'm making this a quick one. Gotta tend to business in a while.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Having said that, I'll just have the usual."
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(The usual he says...)
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The usual.
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Sure, this'll work."
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The usual.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Glad to see that being offended doesn't affect your service.
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not offended, just... irked."
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey, it's all your fault. You're the one feeling offended."
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I didn't call you ugly, just flat. Which you are!"
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Are you gonna mess up my order just because of that?
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What brings you today, Mr. Donovan?"
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,That girl I interviewed yesterday is coming again in a couple of weeks.
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So, I was working to clinch an exclusive interview."
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you succeed?
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm Donovan D. Dawson. I always get what I want.
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Sure, I had to blackmail the editors of other outlets, but the end result is what matters."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, blackmail?"
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You'd be surprised at the kind of stuff you find out when you get the right people drunk.
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hm? Hey, the signature on that glass over there..."
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ah? Oh yeah...
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,That big titted Lilim was here?!
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She came yesterday before the concert, yeah."
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Anything juicy come out of her visit?
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Gossip-worthy?
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Tabloid-worthy?
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,No.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Come on! There has to be something!
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, her love for what she does is so honest and pure that anyone who tries to ruin it should be ashamed."
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Oh, don't give me that shit."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Throw me a bone here. Anything.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've got nothing.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Everyone has a price. How much for you to spill the beans?
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm serious here. She said nothing that could be used against her or that you didn't already know.
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Fine.
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, are many of your interns women, Mr. Donovan?"
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"ALL of my interns are women, kid."
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Every single one of them. It's a pack of hungry, desperate bitches."
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why only women?
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Did you ever watch ""Race for Hope""?"
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The movie?
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Yeah.
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,A movie about a journalist looking for clues regarding a murder.
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"That tacky movie had everything. Romance, action, a dog with sunglasses..."
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,It also sold this weird fantastical image of what journalism is.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm guessing lots of girls saw it in high school and wanted to become journalists.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And now I have to deal with that shit.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How can you be so sure?
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,My first brother-in-law was a doctor.
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"He said that a couple of years after that ""Emergency Heart"" movie, all of his interns were women for a long while."
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And this why you don't let brats that barely understand what responsibilities are pick a career.
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um...
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you perhaps know a girl named Kimberly La Vallette?
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Doesn't ring a bell. Who is she?
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Um... nobody. Forget I said anything.
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Hey kid, do you think Lilim have nipples?"
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Excuse me?
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I mean, I've seen a couple of pornos where they have 'em, but they could be modded, you know?"
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So yesterday, while interviewing the singer Lilim chick, I kept wondering if those tits had nipples."
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I mean, I'd be fine without them, but the curiosity is killing me."
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But I'm even more curious about the engineers that design them.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Can you picture a room full of people discussing whether or not the tits on a Lilim look good?
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,A bunch of guys and a lesbo engineer wondering if the latest model's vagina is good enough.
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Man, god bless those sonsabitches."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any interesting preview of tomorrow's news?
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You expect me to share my information when you wouldn't share your scoop on the singer?
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How can one share when there's honestly nothing to share?
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Uh huh...
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm gonna be a good citizen today and let this one pass.
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Have you heard of a group called ""The Harbingers""?"
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not really, no."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They're some group wanting to overthrow the White Knights.
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I read their manifesto in the bathroom once. Interesting piece and even better makeshift toilet paper.
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"They talk about how the organization is corrupt, full of mob bosses or something like that."
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I think I've heard about that somewhere. What of them?
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,They sent a message to some outlets saying they have proof of their claims.
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,That they're gonna release it to the public tomorrow.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... that'd be interesting to see. I think...
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"I know, right?"
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Alright, kid. Give me a Bleeding Jane so I can call it a day."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Simple enough for you, I see."
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Well, aren't you a cheeky one?"
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,My second wife is more of a Bleeding Jane than this.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Better luck next time, kid."
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"So, I've heard this is Dana Zane's bar. Is it true?"
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Never thought I'd hear about the Undefeated of the West again.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Moreso after that incident with the bears. Where is she?
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She's out running some err-... bears?
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Six years ago, a cash-strapped Dana Zane entered an underground ring for money."
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Faced ten enraged grizzly bears. She beat them all without killing them.
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I heard she set them free afterwards too.
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And you were there?
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I was drunk and bored. What can I say?
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you know if she lost her arm there?
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Can't remember, too drunk. Maybe she had her prosthetic then too."
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I heard someone there suggest that she lost it after throwing a baseball out of some stadium.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Threw it so hard her arm fell off.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But that sounds more like an unsubstantiated rumor.
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(More like something she made up.)
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Well, I gotta go. Next time you see Dana, thank her for winning me my second yacht."
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I knew betting on her was the right choice.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Yeah, yeah..."
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,...
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,You know what? I've had it with that damned newspaper.
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Eh?
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,This newspaper has become a youthful mess where everyone thinks they're the most important thing on the block.
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Even if I didn't have to deal with those employees, the investors and readers are particularly obnoxious."
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And I can't leave them alone because they will still come after my neck when shit hits the fan.
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I'm a rich and powerful man who can't live his rich and powerful life peacefully.
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, they do say money can't buy peace..."
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But it can buy stuff.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"It lets you stay alive, gives you shelter, and can make you comfortable. And I'm not comfortable."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"Not because I managed things the wrong way, but because others won't let me be."
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,And this fella has had enough of it.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you gonna do?
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Read tomorrow's edition kid. You'll find a nice surprise there.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(He's either going to kill somebody or post pics of his dick in every article.)
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You know what? I've come to like you, kid."
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...really?
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"You keep quiet, don't talk unless talked to, and listen attentively to everything I say."
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"If you had more tits and ass, I'd take you out of here right now."
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"But there's surgery for that, so the sky's the limit!"
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,But I know the reality. You're just listening to me because I'm a client.
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,I can't help but wonder how you are outside of work.
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Maybe it's better if I don't know.
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Enough about you. It's time for some me time.
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,Which means grabbing a bitch and banging her until dawn.
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Mr. Donovan,"See ya, kid."
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Good night.
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*BRRRRRRRRRRR*
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Gil, I'll be taking my break now."
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Alright.
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah, Boss. You're back."
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yeah. Sorry about not being here earlier.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What were you doing?
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I had a brief meeting with my BTC regional manager.
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh... everything alright?
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"As alright as it can be, considering that we're closing eventually."
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,When will that happen?
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I don't know.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Brian said that we'll be safe for a few months while the paperwork is filed and everything's being put in order.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I was also talking to him about you.
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,About me?
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Yeah. I was telling him to do whatever it takes to ensure you don't spend too much time without a job.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"If possible, to reassign you ASAP after closing."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey, if it helps, Brian might be the angriest of us all."
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"""They want to close the only bar in the whole area that hasn't given me any headaches!"" he said."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Heh...
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about Gil?
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"He's the one that worries me the most, actually."
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,He's kinda working using the credentials of another guy that was working here before.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who?
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The one who bought a levitation potion and then threw himself off a building.
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Ah yes, the ""levitation potion"" story.)"
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You use weird euphemisms, Boss."
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,...anyway.
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I find it hard to believe that Gil will find a job after all this.
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...just who is Gil?
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I have an idea of who he is... but I'm still putting pieces together.
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, back to work. Imminent closure is no excuse to slack off."
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yessir!
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"...you guys do know I can hear you, right?"
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,This place looks familiar...
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Excuse me, is this the... VA-11 Hall-A bar?"
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It is indeed. Welcome to Valhalla.
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"...oh god, what is Sei planning now?"
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Excuse me?
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I want a drink whose name was changed after many women protested. Can you get me that?
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Very nice. Thanks a lot.
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you are.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"*sigh* You just gave up mid way through, didn't you?"
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh...
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, you know Sei, miss...?"
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm Stella Hoshii. My pleasure.
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,My name's in the payment registry.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Stella... Hoshii. Is that right?
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Why not just tell me directly though?)
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah. I know her. She's been here before, yes?"
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yup. In fact, I'm glad you know her because she left this here last time."
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"...oh, god. So she left her helmet behind, again."
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not the first time, huh?"
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Her helmets have been picked up by all sorts of people in the last three months.
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Valets, nurses, morticians, fire jugglers..."
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She's been lucky enough to always leave it with people who return it, at least."
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Whoa, quite a few people."
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sei's as much of a sociable girl as she is a total klutz.
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,At least when she's not being serious. She's very competent when she puts her mind to it.
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So did she recommend you this place or...?
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,We're meeting here today.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I can see why she chose this place. It's the kind of place she likes.
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm just waiting for her here.
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Hm...
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Say, is that *Kira* Miki's autograph on that glass?"
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Seems like the glass is a conversation starter. Nice.)
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, it is."
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,How did you get it?
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She stopped here yesterday just before the concert.
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,REALLY?!
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...I mean...
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,She did?
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah. Nice girl.
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Can I see it?
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sure.
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yup, this star-like signature is hers."
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,So your name's Jill then?
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yes.
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Ain't this nice?
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Here you go.
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you like her, Miss Stella?"
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Just call me Stella.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I do.
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Whenever you hear her songs, you're filled with so much energy and happiness."
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I heard she even opened with a new version of Shine Spark!
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'm so vexed that I couldn't purchase a ticket for this one.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,New version?
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yes, I heard a leak from the event. It felt more... how to put it... hot blooded."
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(She definitely took the ""Dark"" act too far.)"
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Too bad I couldn't purchase tickets for this one.
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I mean, they were sold out in minutes!"
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Luckily I could secure a couple for the next time she comes around.
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,And I've only listened to a couple of her songs. Honestly.
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"T-They're catchy, I guess. But that's it."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see...
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(She's such a bad liar.)
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Oh, excuse me for a second."
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Hello? Where the hell are you?!
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Car crash?! Oh, you're helping."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Will it take long? Alright.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, yeah. Don't worry."
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I take it that was Sei.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Yes.
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you wait for her?
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I will.
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"In the meantime, I feel like having another drink."
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,One that was prepared in memory of its creator's dearest friend.
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is this the one you had in mind?
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yes, exactly."
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Thank you.
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Maybe I'm being too cryptic, but you should know these ones already..."
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(She's not wrong...)
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,May I ask you something that might be personal?
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"It isn't about my eye, is it?"
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, it's not... or at least I don't think so."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't get to serve many Cat Boomers, so it's something I've been curious about."
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you go through the procedure because of a disease or because of the fad?
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Before I was born, I was diagnosed with Nanomachine Rejection."
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"So, it had to be done. Otherwise, I would've died shortly after birth."
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'm a bit on the weak side because of it, though."
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm sorry if I overstepped.
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I don't mind.
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It's always nice to dispel the idea that my parents were just into the fad.
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'd rather not talk about it.
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My deepest apologies then.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It's fine.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You seem to know your drinks, Jill."
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I guess I've read a bit more than the recipe book."
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Do you like alcohol?
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, but not in the usual way. I don't drink that much outside of canned Beer."
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But their colors, their stories, the way you need to keep them stored, their designs..."
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It sounds a bit silly when I say it out loud.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Not at all.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Do you collect them or anything like that?
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Actually, yeah. I started with my grandpa's collection and have been slowly growing it."
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's been hard because of my debts, but I manage, little by little."
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Do you like alcohol, Stella?"
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I'm here, right?"
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,But I'm normally more of a social drinker.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Unless it's with somebody, I don't tend to drink much."
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Your co-worker has been acting strange for a while now.
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey Gil, you ok?"
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Yeah, I'm just gonna take my break. Seems my allergies have started acting up."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Allergies?
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Yeah, yeah. Stare at the cat-eared girl when allergies enter the fray. How classy."
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I said nothing.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...!
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"S-So, Gil and Jill. isn't that confusing?"
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sometimes, yeah."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Sorry I'm late!!
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome.
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You took your sweet time.
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, sorry! Sorry."
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I got caught in rush hour traffic too and figured walking might be faster.
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Luckily, there was a building with emergency stairs nearby and I climbed down."
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Climbed down""?"
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Took an air cab.
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I would suggest using ground transportation, but I'm happy to see you put safety first."
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Safety? No, no... flying cars are just way cooler."
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I still don't understand how they don't give you motion sickness.
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"If I find out how I avoid it, you'll be the first to know."
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Anyway, I'll have whatever she orders next."
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'd like a drink that was...
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You're at it again? You and your cryptic orders always leaving us with weird stuff.
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Hey, I expect only the best from whoever serves me."
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,They need to be able to answer these kind of orders.
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Still, I'm sure you're wearing poor Jill here out with that kind of stuff."
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"She's done quite well so far, actually."
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Really?
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank you.
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...maybe.
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Whatever. Please order something normal, would you?"
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"That'll be two Fringe Weavers, then."
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You'll have two drinks at once?
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"No, we're sharing."
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,What? Like half a glass for each? Isn't it better if it's one for each?
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Don't worry, you'll see."
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Two Fringe Weavers.
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,So?
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"This one's for you and this one's for me. You said you wanted whatever I asked for, right?"
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oooooh, that way. You could've said so earlier."
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Mm hmm.
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Here, you have the Fringe whatever. I'm fine with the other drink."
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,T-Thanks...
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,See? You made Jill give us other stuff because you've been too picky.
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Sure, let's go with that.)"
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, here."
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Hey! So this is where I left my helmet. Thanks!
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You stupid, stupid, stupid woman."
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,E-Eh?
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,How do you lose your helmet so easily?!
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"What if something falls on your head?! You'd be left even more stupid than you are now, you stupid!"
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I-It's okay, I have a couple of spares."
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,It's not okay! It's never okay! What would I do without you?!
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"If something happens to you, how could I... *sniff*"
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'll be fine, I'll be fine..."
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Wait... does this have something to do with me going to the bank tomorrow?
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,M-Maybe...
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You're still worried about rumors of those Harbinger guys?
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Yeah...
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Don't be. You know that even if they do come, I can take care of them!"
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"I know, but..."
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"If I could ditch the meeting tomorrow, I would. But I have to go to that bank."
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You promise to come back?
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,We'll have ice cream.
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Yay~
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Sei... I'm tired...
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Sleep for a bit. I'll wake you up when we leave.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Aight.
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Sorry, I don't think she's allowed to sleep here, huh?"
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you're taking care of her, it's fine."
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Sorry.
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've seen people change drastically when getting drunk, but her case is... interesting."
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She's always been a spoiled kid. I guess alcohol brings it out.
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,What was that Latin phrase again? Vini Vidi Vici?
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Memento Mori? Carpe Diem?
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,No... it was something like... In Vino Termitas.
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,In Vino Veritas?
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah! That's the one.
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,You really need to be more careful with your things.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah, but I have spares!"
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Those spares should be saved for when the one you're using breaks or malfunctions, not when you lose it."
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Those helmets cost money, you know?"
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yeah. Sorry...
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Should I say that Boss got her head stuck because of a jammed button?)
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Speaking of money, you still going to that meeting at the bank tomorrow?"
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yup. You worried?
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(I'll refrain for now.)
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Don't be! It'll be fine. Rumors are just rumors.
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Rumors?
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,They say something might happen at the bank tomorrow.
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"But with all the tension in the air lately, it's hard to know if it's true."
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"As if the fear mongering wasn't enough, the people have also started spreading baseless rumors."
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Just yesterday I had to stop a group of rampaging youngsters that heard the city would be leveled by bombs.
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,*sigh* Everyone's on edge.
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...yeah.
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I know you're worried, but I have to go there. It's orders from the higher ups."
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Tell me something. If somebody came after me, do you think they'd stand a chance?"
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"You're quite strong, but..."
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'll take something to protect myself, be prepared for anything."
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Would that make you feel safer?
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Maybe...
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'll tell you what, after I come back we'll get some ice cream. That way you can vent all your frustrations."
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,...alright.
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,"Seems my vehicle is here to pick me up. You coming, Sei?"
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Nah, I'll stay here a bit longer."
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,Okay then. Take care.
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Bye.
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She's such a worrywart.
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That means she cares about you.
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I've never doubted.
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Say... why does my helmet smell like bacon?
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh... bacon?
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Not that I mind. I'm just curious.
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, you know how some things absorb the smell of what's nearby? It must've grabbed it from one of the ingredients."
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I see.
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you believe all that stuff about tensions growing and that anarchist group trying to disband the White Knights?
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"To tell you the truth, I am a bit worried."
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Even in my division, there's some shady business going on. But I don't want to investigate too deeply."
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of business?
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"From what I understand... things like working with human traffickers or drug dealers, letting them act as they wish."
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Some even say the ones that do get apprehended are the ones that have failed them in some way.
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Stella always says ""the White Knights are just glorified mall security."""
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,She says that if it's been proven beyond a doubt that some shady business is going on...
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Zaibatsu Corp's main branch would separate themselves from the whole White Knight division.
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Something about the associates' fear of bad PR resulting in them moving to the BTC.
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sounds plausible.
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Yeah. It kinda worries me, though, because I really like my job."
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,And I guess a similar fear exists among the upper ranks. Lately they seem... restless.
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Too much politics, huh?"
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It hurts my brain. I just want to rescue people and help them.
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I just wanna do my job without worries about politics of any kind.
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you doing at the bank tomorrow?
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"My colonel needed to relay some information to the manager, and I was picked because he trusted me."
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, he said ""You're such a simpleton that you'd never give the wrong message"", but it's his intention that counts."
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,O-Oh...
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,FINALLY! THE DOROTHY HAS COME BACK TO VALHALLA!
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please refrain from doing those sitcom-like entrances. You're disturbing other clients.
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh, come on! You know the audience would've gone wild with that one."
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"And besides, you make it sound like you have a full house."
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*ahem*
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's uncommon to see you here two days in a row.
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I wanted to grab something before starting my shift.
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Grab something before they start grabbing me, you could say."
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Hey, you having a drink? Can I buy you one?"
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Why yes! Thank you.
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, you should follow her example and offer me drinks more often."
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,We'll see.
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you having?
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I'll have what she's having.
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Then I've got the perfect thing. Let's have a Blue Fairy.
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,One for both?
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,One for each!
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Two fairies.
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Hey, this is pretty good."
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,See?
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And it's blue like your hair.
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,It is!
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You have the Fairy. I'm fine with the other.
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Even though you invited me?
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Don't worry.
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Honey, this isn't blue, and it's certainly not a fairy."
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I don't know. I like it.
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"She got the drink wrong, regardless."
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, what's your name, sweetie?"
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Call me Sei.
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Alright Sei, I'm Dorothy."
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Say Sei...
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yes yes?
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sei say.
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Yes yes?
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Say say.
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sei Sei.
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Sei... why did you just buy me a drink?
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I just thought you were cute as a button so I wanted to invite you to join me.
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Wow, you have to be the first person to offer me a drink without having an ulterior motive."
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And that includes Fuckboy over there.
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do you mean?
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Trust me, when you work in my kind of field, you learn to read cues from everything."
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And this girl is simple to a fault.
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,How so?
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You're the ""what you see is what you get"" type."
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That look on your face is of one that simply sees no point in lying.
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Coupled with the fact that you're here in what looks like your work attire tells me...
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,That you're so married to your job that sex is too far down your priority list to notice its existence.
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"So, if you invited me to a drink because you found me cute and that's the extent of it, I believe you."
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Thank you!
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You say she's the first one, but what about Deal giving you a ticket the other day?"
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Who? Oh yeah! The Lilim with the dogs.
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"No, he doesn't count. He looked like a humanoid mat."
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ouch...
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"You seem very perceptive, Dorothy. But I'm not too far behind!"
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,How so?
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,I can tell your body is heavily modded with things you shouldn't even have.
801,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...
802,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Your tongue is a BEB069 with DNA scanning capabilities.
803,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Your skin is coated with an anti-radiation finish.
804,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Your joints are of the premium, extra-flexible variety."
805,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,And the most important thing... your hands.
806,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,W-What about them?
807,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I don't know how modded your body is under your clothes. The tongue, joints and skin are merely interesting."
808,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,But your hands are the MIRD113 of Realta Industries...
809,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,A model designed to shoot Class-5 bullets from its fingertips.
810,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,S-So...?
811,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Clause G of article 17 in the Augmentations and Modifications law on the topic of ballistic augmentations.
812,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"""Any humanoid or sapient creature under civilian designation that has upgraded any of its person..."
813,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"...to hold fire arms of Class-3 grade or higher will be either commissioned for disarmament or sent to danger zones."""
814,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...w-what are you gonna do?
815,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Nothing.
816,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Eh?
817,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I'm not in law enforcement. I just do rescue. And even if I was, I'm not on duty right now."
818,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,O-Oh...
819,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"I want to know, though. Why go through with that upgrade?"
820,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"A girl's gotta take care of herself, you know?"
821,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I wanna be able to deal with things if they get ugly. And this is the most discreet mod I had.
822,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,...or at least I thought so.
823,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Oh! Yeah, yeah."
824,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Okay then. Can I give you some advice?
825,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I guess...?
826,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,The reason I could tell it's not your default hand model is your fingertips.
827,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,The tips are a little bigger to make the cannons fit.
828,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,You could get a small mod that changes them into disposable tips.
829,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"...assuming they're being used for self-defense and not regular use, of course."
830,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I-I see.
831,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Well, I've gotta go. Ah yes, another thing."
832,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"If you aim for the arms or legs, once is self-defense. Anything more is assault."
833,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Y-Yeah...
834,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,"Let's go, Stella."
835,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Stella,*mumble* Yeah...
836,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Bye folks!
837,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Bye bye.
838,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
839,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Sei,Bye Dorothy! Bye Jill!
840,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Bye bye.
841,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
842,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,WAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! I thought she was gonna take me away!
843,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They would put my mind on a vacuum cleaner for three years!
844,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Two if I behave well.
845,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's what happens when you underestimate people.
846,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Although I'm tempted to ask...
847,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,About what?
848,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,DNA-reading tongue?
849,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Very prehensile, intuitive. Also, it vibrates!"
850,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Extra-flexible joints?
851,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Do you really need to ask?
852,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anti-radiation coating?
853,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Hey! My skin's my first tool of the trade. I need to take care of it as much as possible.
854,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And it makes it feel so soft no matter how much it's been battered.
855,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright then...
856,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You made quite the ruckus yesterday, you know?"
857,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Did I? Was I thrashing about screaming ""NO MORE ANAL?"" That has happened before."
858,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...noted.
859,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It wasn't a loud ruckus, you just made everyone uncomfortable with a story you were telling."
860,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh god. It wasn't the one with the donkeys, was it?"
861,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No. Thank god, no."
862,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Good. What happens in Neo-Tijuana stays in Neo-Tijuana.
863,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Now I'm even more grateful.
864,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It was about some mid-school teacher.
865,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Ah yeah, that one... man, that was a nice dick."
866,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I guess I didn't mention the part where he broke down crying afterwards?
867,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He... what?
868,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Yeah... I usually skip that part.
869,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You see... half the times I have a new client, they go through the same routine."
870,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,They muster all their strength and skip to the action.
871,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Then they go nuts in bed... if I'm lucky there WILL be a bed.
872,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And afterwards they become a sobbing mess.
873,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
874,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, imagine you indulged in something society tells you is sick and wrong."
875,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Like emptying a full toothpaste tube.
876,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Only instead of leaving a minty smell in your hands, you fuck an underaged-looking Lilim girl."
877,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Even if it's a ""safe"" scenario meant to let them vent their frustrations and desires..."
878,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,And even if I'm of a mental age where I do everything knowing full well what my actions entail...
879,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Their morals inevitably start kicking them in the nuts.
880,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Therefore, I have to spend extra time telling them that there's nothing wrong with them."
881,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Telling them it's not bad feeling that way, that it's only wrong when they start causing problems to others."
882,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Then again, I suppose I have quite the luck in drawing troubled people to me."
883,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Well, considering your job and your looks...)"
884,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I've tried to convince the mid-school teacher guy to spend another night with me, but he's too stubborn."
885,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You're not helping.
886,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I'm not trying. I need to build up as many regulars as I can!
887,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Well, I gotta go. Came for a drink and that Sei girl gave me one."
888,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Always a pleasure, honey."
889,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
890,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, you fancy yourself a diviner? Reading people and all."
891,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Not really. I'm just quite good at reading people.
892,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,I guess it's a byproduct of dealing with so many people on a daily basis.
893,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It's a bit surreal to hear that from a Lilim.)
894,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What can you say about me, then?"
895,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Let's see... hm...
896,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"You're very, very, VERY sexually frustrated."
897,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"It's not the act itself, but rather that your partners can't seem to satisfy you on a deeper level."
898,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,There's an even deeper frustration. Something happened that's blocking you.
899,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Maybe there's someone who you know won't return your feelings. Maybe you were hurt in the past.
900,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Thus, your demeanor is that of someone who feels like life is playing tricks on her."
901,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Like a dog whose owner never really throws the ball.
902,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
903,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
904,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Oh boy, did I actually hit the nail on the head? I was making this stuff up on the fly!"
905,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,All of that was just rubbish I say because it's right 80% of the time.
906,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,Generic bullshit if you will. You'd be surprised at the amount of sexual frustration people hold.
907,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I can't read you, honey. You're too good at putting on a professional face."
908,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,But this definitely gives me more insight into you. Lucky lucky~
909,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Aren't you late or something?
910,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"I am. But if you'd let me satisfy your frustrations, I could stall for some time."
911,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Go.
912,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dorothy,"Fine, fine... Bye bye, honey."
913,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Artificial intelligence has come rather far, eh? One wonders how artificial it remains."
914,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Shut up, Fuckboy."
915,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Everything done?
916,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
917,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, Boss. This might seem random, but..."
918,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Do you remember the first time I came to the bar?
919,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"When you came to submit your contract? Yeah, why?"
920,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, for some reason I've been hung up on it since this morning, and I just realized why."
921,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The visage that welcomed me back then was... Gil trying to pull your hand out of a jar.
922,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Oh yeah! THAT.
923,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I can't remember what exactly, but something fell inside and I tried to retrieve it."
924,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I just kinda put my hand in and it got stuck. It was a friend's jar too so I couldn't just break it.
925,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Hey Gil, how did you get my hand out of that jar?"
926,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,A straw and some butter.
927,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh yeah, clever solution."
928,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, and that brings me to the random thought."
929,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"That incident, the helmet yesterday, the many times your foot got stuck on something for stomping it..."
930,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss... why do you get stuck in so many different things?
931,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Huh...
932,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Now that you mention it, I remember this one time she tried to eat a big sandwich and her jaw got stuck."
933,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Then there was the incident with the TV...
934,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I'll admit my fault with the others, but the TV incident was NOT my fault."
935,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,The assembly instructions for that stand should have labeled their Z and S better.
936,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You saw what happened when I switched the S2 piece with the 5Z one.
