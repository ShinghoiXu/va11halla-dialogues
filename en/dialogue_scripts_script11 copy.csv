2,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,G'evening.
3,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Ah, hey."
4,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,How are you feeling?
5,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lilim are soft... and warm.
6,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Come again?
7,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You heard me.
8,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"So, on a scale from ""steaming pile of shit"" to just ""sad"", where are you?"
9,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
10,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A sad pile of shit.
11,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I still hate myself, I'm still sad as hell, but... how to put it... the noise stopped."
12,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know if I explained myself.
13,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Sorta, kinda."
14,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"So, how were things last night?"
15,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...cozy, I must admit."
16,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I can't believe you paid Dorothy for that.
17,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Well, if you wanna call that payment, I guess."
18,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
19,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I called Dorothy to tell her what happened to you and she was really concerned.
20,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,She stuttered for a second saying that she had the whole night to go and she couldn't just leave for free.
21,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I asked her how much and she said, ""Enough to pay for this soda I'm having is fine."""
22,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
23,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,How did you get her number?
24,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I have... contacts.
25,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,...right.
26,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyways, Jill. If you need a second break, a drink or a hug... just let me know, you hear?"
27,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
28,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I'd make you the same offer, but I'm guessing hugs from me are the last thing you want."
29,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"If you need a bartender, let me know though."
30,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Nice to know.
31,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyways, we have work to do."
32,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Time to mix drinks and change lives.
33,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"Heh, it's nice to hear that again."
34,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you say something?
35,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,Did I?
36,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
37,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Welcome to Valha-... oh, it's you guys."
38,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Hey! Be more respectful! I brought my boss here.
39,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Aren't you a part-timer here or something?
40,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,My OTHER Boss.
41,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,You're talking to the great Nacho Tumbleweed Jr.!
42,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
43,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...Boss! I'm taking my break!
44,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"I know what I said earlier, but you haven't even started yet!"
45,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shit...
46,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what brings you here today?"
47,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,I wanted to see the place my best soldier is working at.
48,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Soldier""?"
49,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, aren't you the dog I served last Monday?"
50,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,...?
51,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Oh! It's you, Dana!"
52,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Soldier, why didn't you tell me you were working for Dana?"
53,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"No, that's not Dana. That's just J."
54,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
55,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So I'm guessing you're part of this whole CIRA thing.
56,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Part of it? I FOUNDED it!
57,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Humans have the best intentions, but they just don't get us."
58,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,So I decided to create a place where dogs can be dogs.
59,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"""Here, we can take in any dog without a place in this world."""
60,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,We created our own heaven on earth.
61,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And do you take Corgis only?
62,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Do I look like one of those Seifar bitches? Of course not!
63,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"I'd include other animals, but sadly I can only take care of those who are of the same species as I."
64,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Sad thing is, I'd take him more seriously... but it's a talking Corgi with an eyepatch.)"
65,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you get anything?
66,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"I'm fine. What about you, boss?"
67,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Manly stuff.
68,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...you sure?
69,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Did I stutter?
70,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...alright.
71,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
72,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Yes! This is just what I wanted.
73,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,...
74,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,BLEGH! This tastes worse than my own butt.
75,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hey, you asked for it."
76,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
77,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,This looks good.
78,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,...
79,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,BLEGH! This tastes worse than cat poo.
80,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...right.
81,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
82,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Are you underestimating me, kid?"
83,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,I'll let you know I was the top graduate from my paw to hand combat class.
84,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did you really?
85,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Yes! I was the only one to follow MMAJunkie2040's video tutorials to the end.
86,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
87,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"This is a really nice place, you know?"
88,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"You picked a good place to work at, soldier."
89,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Thanks!
90,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Does he really get paid?)
91,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Your efforts to keep CIRA afloat will not go to waste! We'll make her better and better!
92,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I mean, we're pretty much on the verge of closing. Can Boss really afford that?)"
93,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,We have more urgent matters at hand though. Like the fact we don't have enough balls for everyone!
94,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Can't they just share the ones we have?
95,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,You fool! Every dog has a right to have his own ball!
96,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"If we can't provide even that, then what's the point of even trying?!"
97,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Wait... don't tell me she just doesn't give a fuck and is spending all of her money like water.)
98,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(I mean, what with the bar closing and all that.)"
99,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,But many have enjoyed the boxes more than they do the balls!
100,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,That's a good point.
101,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"What do you think is cheaper, a box of balls or a box of boxes?"
102,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Are there boxes of boxes?
103,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Of course there are! How do you think they ship boxes?
104,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Tied together?
105,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Tied together? Don't be silly.
106,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Unless she's paying him straight from her pocket. Boss is that kind of woman.)
107,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"This world is filled with all sort of recursive madness, you know?"
108,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Doctors consult doctors, boxes come in boxes, bottles come in bottles."
109,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Ooooooh, as expected from you, boss."
110,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Wait... that theory only works assuming she's actually paying him with money.)
111,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(For all I know, she might be paying him with steaks.)"
112,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"So tomorrow you're gonna check for people selling boxes, you hear?"
113,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Sir, yes sir!"
114,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(...except that to Boss, a good steak is more valuable than money.)"
115,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Wait, what if they come with foil?"
116,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Russenstrauss had to be taken to the vet because he ate the foil a piece of cheese came in.
117,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,Curses! You're right. We need a contingency plan.
118,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Besides, Boss is not one to scam people, let alone a dog...)"
119,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,I wonder if we can strike a deal with the vet those Seifar bastards have.
120,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,She's always so nice with us.
121,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,I know. Her smile is so cute too.
122,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,So it's better that we vet for a vet?
123,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Yes, put that on the list."
124,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Ah, Nacho."
125,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Oh yeah, forgot she knew the dog.)"
126,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Are you staying for a while?
127,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"I was just passing by, I've got some errands to run."
128,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Great! Gil can go with you.
129,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,I can?
130,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You WILL.
131,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,"I'll still get paid for today, right?"
132,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That depends on Nacho's evaluation.
133,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Nacho,"Alright, greenhorn! Let's get going!"
134,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Gillian,*sigh*
135,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Oh, I'm paying him anyways, by the way. Just wanted to mess around with him."
136,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, that's not the problem here."
137,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why make him do that?
138,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Gil looked like he needed to take a good break, and he's the kind to just not accept such a thing."
139,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"But with Nacho, he'd have SOMETHING to do. AND he'd be away from the bar for a bit."
140,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,When you put it that way...
141,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, I'm going back to my office."
142,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,Your boss sure is nice. Glad I'm working with her too.
143,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Yeah.
144,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, you having anything?"
145,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Actually, I'm just gonna go sit over there and be on standby. Await orders."
146,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
147,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...shit, I missed the chance to ask how, or if he even gets paid with money."
148,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Man, I sure need to get wasted."
149,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I fail to see how getting wasted will make you feel bett-... SHIBAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
150,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"For fuck's sake, you piece of scrap, we just got out of a building full of dogs."
151,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,But this one has a Hawaiian shirt! And sunglasses!
152,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"Hey there, robot."
153,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,And he talks!
154,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sigh*
155,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Welcome to Valhalla.
156,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey Jill.
157,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Get me a Beer, will you?"
158,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Gotcha. Does Deal want anything?
159,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Okay... roll!
160,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Rad Shiba,"SIR, YES SIR!"
161,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,So cute...
162,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,He's fine.
163,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Just a Beer, then."
164,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Friday-after-work isn't just a Beer though. It's THE Beer.
165,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can't argue with that.
166,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Here, let's make it special."
167,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Yeah!
168,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Cheers!
169,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
170,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And thus, this Friday becomes better already."
171,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
172,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,This ain't no Beer.
173,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,But I'll have it anyways. I'm not gonna let you ruin my Friday.
174,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Sorry.
175,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Say, are you okay Jill?"
176,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
177,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You look down, or at least lost in thought."
178,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I do?
179,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, it's not like you're a really expressive girl, but you don't have that... um... sharp look."
180,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I've been through some stuff lately, but I'm getting better. Don't worry."
181,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,If you say so...
182,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That's still no excuse for messing my drink though.
183,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Sorry...
184,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lots of people have noticed that I'm not all that okay. Is it that obvious?
185,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You usually look more attentive. But you are looking a bit lost now.
186,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's hard to put into words.
187,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Hey Jill, do you like Beer?"
188,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The amount of Beer cans in my apartment is becoming a problem, actually."
189,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I had this friend back in high school who made some pretty nice crafts with them.
190,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I'm still in contact with him if you're interested.
191,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, thanks. The last thing I need right now is more crap taking space."
192,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, how are things up at dog town?"
193,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, that Laura girl is stirring things up, for better or for worse."
194,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,For worse?
195,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She's... um... like a rabbit.
196,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,An overtly politically-correct rabbit.
197,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,R-Rabbit?
198,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Never had a pet rabbit? They're a nervous mess that gets startled over the littlest of things.
199,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And this girl is on the constant lookout, scared of saying something that might irk someone."
200,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It doesn't have to be the person she's speaking with, even."
201,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's no problem in the company, but the other day, we went out together and holy shit!"
202,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Poor girl can't speak properly.
203,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She pauses every sentence to make sure she doesn't say something offensive.
204,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"She's a nice girl, and it's sweet that she tries so hard to not offend anyone."
205,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"...but seriously, she tries too hard."
206,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You don't help either.
207,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm?
208,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"You randomly yell ""WHAT DID YOU SAY?!"" whenever she's within earshot distance."
209,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yeah, well..."
210,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's just that... she looks so cute when she's startled.
211,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Like a rabbit.
212,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It raises up the question of whether she's really like that...
213,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...or if you're the one making her wary of anything she says.
214,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, why don't we test that?"
215,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How?
216,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You go out with her.
217,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Why?
218,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,To test if it's really me who makes her like that.
219,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
220,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"It's not like you can say no, you know?"
221,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I mean, it's my honor that's on the line here."
222,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I wanna prove you're only talking shit about me.
223,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Do you, by any chance, remember what happened last time we came here?"
224,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I got drunk. Aaaaaaand that's all I remember after that.
225,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You were rambling about her being head over heels for me or something like that.
226,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I-I did? Damn, I need to keep my mouth shut when drunk."
227,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Well, It's not like I'm trying to do that. You know?"
228,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...right.
229,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Even if you were right, you have... quite the fixation on that girl."
230,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She's fun.
231,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Fun how?
232,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She actually reacts when I tease her.
233,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
234,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"You take it in your stride, but she actually gets startled, squirms and then gets uncomfortable!"
235,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How is that any good?
236,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She's cute and her reactions are cute.
237,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"But if you keep it up, she'll either leave or get used to you."
238,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You know... like me.
239,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Shit. You're right.
240,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I must save my teasing for when the moment is just right, then."
241,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"No, that's not the problem."
242,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It is for me.
243,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And what are you doing here? What about the dog?
244,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,He said he had to go out...
245,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"By the way, he said his name was-..."
246,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Say, this Laura girl. Do you guys get along?"
247,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I wouldn't know. We get along as co-workers at the very least.
248,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
249,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What kind of girl is she? Aside from the whole politically-correct rabbit... thing.
250,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Slow.
251,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"She's the kind that does things so carefully that she does them really, really slowly."
252,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Really, REALLY slowly."
253,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I can't deny that when she actually finishes stuff, she does a great job, but..."
254,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's unnerving.
255,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,She doesn't actually have to be with us in the building though. She's more like a freelancer.
256,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why is she there then?
257,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Because she likes dogs.
258,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And that's why I insist that you two would make a fine couple.
259,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,That's a really superficial statement. It's like saying you'd be fine with someone because you're both women.
260,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
261,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Okay... bad example.
262,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,May I say something?
263,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,By all means.
264,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If that Laura girl is really as... bland as you claim her to be, wouldn't she be better off with a more... um..."
265,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A more assertive person... Lilim... uh...
266,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A more assertive partner?
267,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Yo, piece o' scrap, she's totally calling you a pussy."
268,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
269,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,She's right though.
270,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sharing interests and being compatible are totally different things.
271,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But then, you'd be underestimating the power of LOOOOOOOOOVE."
272,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Whether you want to admit it or not, love changes people for better or for worse."
273,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Who knows? Maybe you'll become more assertive after spending time with her.
274,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Or she'll drive me nuts.
275,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I guess that's a possibility too.
276,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Still, why are you so insistent on me and her getting together?"
277,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Because she's like a cute rabbit... so someone might try to eat her out there.
278,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It'd be a lot easier to keep her in my sight.
279,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"So in short, your motherly instincts arose because of Laura."
280,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,*sigh* Why not see if she likes you and-...
281,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"...you already tried to hit on her, didn't you?"
282,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,You make me sound like some skirt-chaser.
283,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
284,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...she's not into girls.
285,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How did you find out?
286,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I asked her directly.
287,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Of course you did.
288,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She seemed... um... giddy afterwards though.
289,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I heard her muttering something about meeting her first lesbian...
290,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It was weird.
291,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Okay... enough Laura for a night.
292,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That-...
293,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Refrain from using any ""That's what you said last night"" jokes or variations thereof. Please."
294,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...party pooper.
295,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Let's get a drink then.
296,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Sounds good.
297,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"I'll have a Bloom Light, please."
298,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Get me a Fringe Weaver.
299,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
300,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
301,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I wonder why it's called a Bloom Light.
302,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Seems it was first developed at some video games event.
303,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The creator said something about making the attendees feel like their customers do.
304,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Said attendees were, of course, part of some big games company."
305,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Seems that company always used too much bloom lighting, so the bartender there literally made them drink all the bloom."
306,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So it's not called that because it glows in the dark?
307,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not this one, no."
308,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
309,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"First, she calls you a pussy, and now she messes up your drink?"
310,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"If I were you, I'd be mad."
311,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"No, wait. If I were you, I'd do nothing and let it slide."
312,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It's better than getting thrown out of a restaurant because you insulted the head chef.
313,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That meat was raw and you know it!
314,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,It was Venison Tartare.
315,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Your point being?
316,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,...
317,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
318,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"I don't mind if you're apologizing for calling him a pussy, you've still messed up my drink."
319,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"She might not be apologizing to me, you know?"
320,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Then that'd mean she's holding a grudge against me instead!
321,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"My god, that stoic look of yours almost got my guard down."
322,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
323,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
324,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why two of these?
325,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Because... you're a... blooming beauty?
326,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"That's bullshit, but I believe it."
327,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
328,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sigh* Not a single drink right.
329,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,S-Sorry.
330,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Come to think of it. Did you ever change because of a relationship, Jill?"
331,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
332,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In more ways than one, I guess."
333,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Would you say for better or for worse?
334,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess for the better. I'm too thick-headed to develop any new bad habits.
335,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Although thanks to my first boyfriend, I did pick up a very annoying habit of correcting people's grammar on the fly."
336,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pretty annoying when I think back to it.
337,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,So you were one of those kinds of people.
338,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"As for me, sometimes I think I became more... err... what's the word?"
339,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Cynical? Jaded? Bitter? Tired of the crap this world and everyone in it throws on a daily basis?
340,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Hey...
341,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I'm just quoting you.
342,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,*sigh* But yeah. I think I became all that because of this one girlfriend I had in college.
343,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,She got me into the whole activism thing in the first place.
344,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,How is that bad?
345,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,We'd all go and protest. We'd start all kinds of movements to see things changed...
346,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I really got into the whole thing.
347,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But whenever I wanted to get more serious, I'd find myself coming up against a wall."
348,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,That wall is an analogy for the fact that not everyone was willing to go that far.
349,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,I found out pretty fast that most of them were in the whole thing because of some shitty fad.
350,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,And not because they actually believed in whatever movement they were championing.
351,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"So I moved from group to group, only to find people who were in it because of a fad."
352,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"And when they were not in it because of a passing fad, they were of the dangerous extremist kind."
353,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,My tolerance for people's shit was greatly diminished after all that.
354,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So it wasn't so much the person you had a relationship with, but rather other people."
355,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...um.
356,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You seriously never thought about it that way?
357,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Uh...
358,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You need to stop putting the blame for what you do on past relationships.
359,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Whatever!
360,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"So, how did you spend last Saturday, Jill?"
361,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I had to sleep here. The streets were too messy."
362,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thank god my boss escorted to my place on Sunday.
363,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,We arrived at work on Monday only to find all the dogs hiding behind the desks.
364,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Some were trying to open a hole in the floor, so the carpet's ruined."
365,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh yeah... I guess they're dogs after all.
366,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Wait, they spent the whole time there?"
367,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"They have food, water and a bathroom. Not to mention advanced security measures."
368,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Their owners probably thought it'd be safer for them to stay there.
369,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"If you ask me, the whole thing had to happen."
370,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Given all the gunshots and madness going on, the White Knights had to show their true faces sooner or later."
371,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Yeah, but think of all the people that died because of that."
372,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Not only here, but in the Apollo Trust Bank too."
373,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Of course I'm angry all of that happened. A friend's boyfriend died in one of those riots.
374,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But in the end, they showed people outside of the city that there's a lot of corruption and chaos taking place here."
375,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Having neighboring cities intervene in the riots is evidence enough that they realized the magnitude of the problem.
376,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You'd think with the world pretty much connected, everyone would realize stuff like that."
377,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Many know about it. They just say ""Man, that's horrible"" and move on."
378,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Then again, net activism can only get you so far with this kind of stuff."
379,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,It's not like a bunch of people expressing their concerns online will do that much of a difference.
380,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"But if they at least get to know how bad things are around here, instead of just knowing they're 'bad'..."
381,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Aren't you seeing that with a harsh sort of ""to each their own"" mentality?"
382,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,How so?
383,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Many people leave the city, but not of their own volition."
384,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,They do it because they have a better opportunity outside. But they still have families here.
385,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Many have visited the city in better times, and it hurts them to see it like this."
386,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Problem is that written words usually fail to convey the emotion needed...
387,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,But I bet many of them would do what they can.
388,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,...
389,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...from a more cynical standpoint...
390,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Having revealed the White Knights as the ""bad guys"" with the help of irrefutable evidence.."
391,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Anyone who gets involved against them gets a free PR boost.
392,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I heard a neighboring city had a problem with weapons being smuggled into prisons...
393,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And it all went under the radar because they helped with the situation here.
394,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's not too bad if we benefit from people looking to get into that bandwagon.
395,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Especially if it helps us with this situation.
396,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"See, piece o' junk? She understands how to get her idea through to me."
397,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I like his idealist standpoint a lot more though.
398,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You'd be surprised at the nice things people can and will do to help others.
399,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Yeah!
400,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Where's the other guy, by the way?"
401,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,He... had to escort one of the dogs outside.
402,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Figures.
403,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"Oh, yeah. The one that was here asked if you were ""the nice vet lady that works at the Seifar Toy Company."""
404,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I suppose he's interested in talking to you or something.
405,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Why didn't he do it then?
406,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,I don't know.
407,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"You've been doing a few jobs on the side, haven't you?"
408,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,The pay from the dogs isn't enough to keep up with the mounting debts. I don't know how you do it.
409,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(It's hard to believe dogs pay you at all...)
410,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(...but this is coming from someone working at a place that pays a dog for doing fuck all.)
411,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(Or at least I THINK we're paying him. I'm not completely certain we do.)
412,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Will you get anything else?
413,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Well...
414,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"We're fine, but we have to get up early tomorrow. And by ""we,"" I really mean her."
415,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,"She got invited to a picnic and I won't stand to hear another ""had to go to a picnic with a hangover"" story."
416,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Fiiiiiiiiiine.
417,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,Let's go then.
418,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"See ya, Jill."
419,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,Bye.
420,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Please come again.
421,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Betty,"Man, you're such a party pooper."
422,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Deal,You'll be the party pooper tomorrow if you keep drinking.
423,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Boss, I'll take my break! Call me if someone comes."
424,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Alright.
425,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Okay then, back to work."
426,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Welcome to Valha-... oh, hey there Alma."
427,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
428,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
429,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
430,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Umm...
431,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh*
432,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,(She seems down... maybe there's something I can give her to cheer her up?)
433,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hey!
434,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm? And this?
435,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"It's on me. Drink, so you at least change your expression."
436,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Why not just say you're worried about me?
437,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You got the message anyway, didn't you?"
438,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Heh...
439,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,So? How is it?
440,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,A Brandtini! So you do pay attention to what I ask for!
441,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You have quite the fixation with Brandtinis.
442,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"To be honest, they suit you."
443,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, wanna hear a silly story?"
444,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Always.
445,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"When I turned 21, my dad and I went to a bar to celebrate. Just him and I."
446,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"He told me to dress well enough that he ""looked like my sugar daddy""."
447,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It was a fun night. We pretended at times we were dating. I managed to blow off some steam about my mom...
448,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But the highlight was him ordering a Brandtini for me.
449,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I've had plenty of drinks and gotten wasted many times since I was 15, but that drink was different."
450,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It wasn't about getting drunk. The drink itself was the pleasure.
451,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He too said they suited me somehow.
452,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh?
453,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Ever since that day, he's called me ""Brandtini girl"" from time to time."
454,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Your dad sounds like a cool guy.
455,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You should meet him sometime.
456,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, it's not bad..."
457,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Sweet things always soothe me, so I figured it would help you too."
458,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You sound like my little brother.
459,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Just replace ""Sweet"" with ""Meat"" though."
460,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh.
461,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, it has alcohol, and I'm in a bar, so..."
462,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Good enough, I guess."
463,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I got you to speak. That's all I wanted.
464,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What? You're gonna jinx me or something?
465,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No, but you being down and silent is... uncanny."
466,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You're making it sound like I'm some sort of windbag.
467,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You know what I mean.
468,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, I do. Thanks."
469,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
470,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And this is?
471,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"A drink? You're in a bar, remember?"
472,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,This doesn't appear to have any alcohol.
473,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's still a drink.
474,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, but what good is it without alcohol?"
475,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,For throwing into your face?
476,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"That's one way of seeing things, I guess."
477,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, why are you deflating?"
478,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Deflating?
479,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,When I got sad and started sighing repeatedly...
480,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My grandpa would warn me that I would start deflating like an old tire if I kept it up.
481,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Heheh...
482,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, what is it? Was it the news about people dressing in bunny suits after the whole Alice_Rabbit boom?"
483,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Nah, that is old news."
484,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I mean, it IS a problem, but such a thing would only annoy me."
485,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...say Jill, how's your mood right now? I wanna ruin it by blowing off all my stored steam."
486,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Silly Alma. I've been feeling like utter shit the last couple of days. You can't make me feel worse.
487,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, go ahead. Unwind all your worries on me."
488,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Don't say I didn't warn you.
489,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Okay, so... remember my sister Dayana?"
490,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,The one that separated from her husband and forgot her kids while fucking her way around or something?
491,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Perfect summary. I'll use it next time.
492,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I didn't tell you the whole story then. More specifically, that she threw her husband out after months of abuse."
493,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Oh...
494,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"However, that woman is incapable of getting a job and maintaining herself."
495,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And I mean that. She never even thinks about selling some stuff or trying to earn her bread.
496,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She just EXPECTS a guy to do all that for her.
497,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I have no idea why she turned out like that. Both my mom and dad were hard workers.
498,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,They even started a small shop to have something to do after retirement.
499,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Huh...
500,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So... what does this fully capable woman do a couple of weeks later?
501,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Why, bring her abusive husband back of course!"
502,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...what?
503,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, and the guy spent a couple of days with her before leaving her again."
504,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He had a nice couple of hot steamy nights and then left!
505,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...I-I... well...
506,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Huh, you reacted like my lil' brother and sister after hearing that."
507,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But the story doesn't end there. Oh no.
508,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So she's broke and can't even get enough for a bus.
509,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Even though she'd probably be glad to sell her ass just to get money.
510,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And it was up to ME to pick her up.
511,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"For the last couple of days, she left her kids with my parents."
512,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...and being such sweet angels, they've made a mess out of the whole place."
513,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Bernardo and Eva are actually staying with me a couple of days to give 'em some peace.
514,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It doesn't help that I never got along with Dayana.
515,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, we're in the car and she asks how her kids are."
516,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"And of course. After all the built-up tension, I just... exploded."
517,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"First, I started ranting about how her kids are growing up seeing some messed-up stuff."
518,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I start scolding her about not taking responsibility, about not taking proper care of her children."
519,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I tell her that she's in no place to have all those escapades...
520,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"And after all that, she just says..."
521,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"""What the hell do you know? You don't have any kids!"""
522,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
523,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Yeah, you slutty skank. I don't have kids but I'm not broke just because I refuse to take a job!"
524,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't have kids, but I'm not leaving them in the first barely familiar house I find."
525,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't have kids, but I'm not letting the guy that hit me on a regular basis back into my bed."
526,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I don't have kids, but I pretty much raised Eva and Bernardo and they've turned out pretty damn well!"
527,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I DON'T HAVE ANY KIDS BUT I'M NOT A CHEAP WHOOOOOOOOORE!!!
528,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!!
529,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...damn.
530,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I... don't know what to say.
531,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,There's nothing to say.
532,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I love my family and I put them above all else...
533,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...but Dayana is seriously pushing the boundaries of what I can allow.
534,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Any way I could help?
535,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You just did.
536,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
537,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I know who I'm dealing with. I'm not one to let stuff like that get to me.
538,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I'm still angry as hell though, and I couldn't just discuss this with any of my family members."
539,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I can't tell my mom ""Your daughter is a slut""."
540,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I just... needed to get all of this off my chest, you know?"
541,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, from what I see there's still a lot more to get off your chest. It's swollen as fuck."
542,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Nah, all you see here is filled with love and dreams."
543,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Is everyone in your family as busty as you?
544,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,The worst offender is my dad actually.
545,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Kidding, kidding."
546,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I guess the only one that didn't get the big boobs gene was Eva.
547,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"She insists on getting surgery or genetic treatment, but I tell her she's fine the way she is."
548,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,These can actually be more of a hassle than a blessing.
549,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And poor Bernardo. His breasts actually started growing when he was 8.
550,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I just hope I don't take too much from my mother's side of the family.
551,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"My father's sisters still look quite young. But when menopause hit, my mom lost her looks rather quickly."
552,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Any good genes you got from your family, Jill?"
553,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Good enough skin and hair, I guess."
554,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"There's a thing about a shrimp allergy, but so far I haven't had problems with that."
555,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, I see."
556,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
557,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, you know what worries me the most about the whole Dayana situation?"
558,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How your nephews are turning out?
559,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If she leaves them with my mom, they'll turn out better than her... somehow."
560,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Actually, what worries me is... what if I end up like that too?"
561,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,How so?
562,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If I find a good man and I settle down, what if he turns out shitty?"
563,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"What if I have a sudden burst where I wanna ""live my life"" and end up like that?"
564,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What if I have kids and I end up neglecting them because of all that?
565,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"If you ask me, the fact that you're even worried about it is indication enough that you'll be fine."
566,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You think?
567,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm pretty sure.
568,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You said before that she pretty much married the guy after a couple of months, right?"
569,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Yeah.
570,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No offense, but those are the kind of people who wouldn't even think about all that."
571,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Besides, if any guy ends up marrying you, it's because he passed your irrational standards."
572,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hey!
573,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Am I lying?
574,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,No... but there are things best kept as unspoken truths.
575,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*sigh* I wonder if I'll ever find a good guy.
576,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You will. You'll know when the time comes.
577,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I sure hope so.
578,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"For now, the time has come to get another drink."
579,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What can I get you?
580,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm...
581,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Get me something with ice, but alcoholic please."
582,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Alright.
583,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
584,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Thanks, I needed to cool down a bit."
585,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's why I'm here.
586,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
587,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Than-... umm...
588,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Where's the ice here?
589,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Uh... melted.
590,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Right...
591,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
592,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
593,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Jill. This is softer than a pillow on Monday morning. And I don't mean it in a good way.
594,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"I'll drink it, but..."
595,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-Yeah... Sorry.
596,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
597,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Don't worry, I told you.  I'm fine. Thanks."
598,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I appreciate the gesture though.
599,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Just making sure.
600,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, you said you felt shitty the last couple of days. Why?"
601,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't think too much about it.
602,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Oh, come on! You heard my problems. I wanna help you too."
603,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't worry too much.
604,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right! I almost forgot to tell you something.
605,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What is it?
606,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,My boss is throwing a Mega Christmas party this Sunday. You wanna come?
607,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure. Something tells me this Mega Christmas is gonna be a mess at my parents' home, so I'd rather avoid it."
608,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Are you guys getting chicken? I can get one.
609,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Hm... to be honest, I wouldn't know."
610,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You can bring it if you want. It won't go to waste.
611,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Gotcha.
612,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hm... say Jill, what's your favorite part of the chicken?"
613,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Favorite part... I guess I like legs the most.
614,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Really? I like breast better.
615,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Breast is a bit too simple, don't you think? Legs have a better texture."
616,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Maybe, but simple is usually better. Breast is easier to enjoy than legs... and a lot less messy."
617,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Hmhmhm... you silly girls.
618,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Boss?
619,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You're there talking about breasts and legs when everyone knows the best parts are the WINGS.
620,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...Boss, what's that?"
621,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Spicy chicken wings.
622,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Where did you get spicy chicken wings?
623,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,From a Spicy Chicken.
624,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"You know, Spicy Chicken, the shop two blocks from here."
625,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...sorry, let me rephrase that. Why are you carrying a bucket of spicy chicken wings?"
626,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Why AREN'T you carrying a bucket of spicy chicken wings?
627,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Well... because... eh?
628,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Thought as much.
629,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Yo, Armitage."
630,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Alma.
631,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,I know what I said.
632,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Will the chicken you're talking about be cooked already?
633,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You might need to heat it up.
634,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,But it'd be cooked otherwise.
635,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Great! I expect you here Sunday at 8 P.M.
636,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Thanks.
637,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, I'll be back to my office."
638,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
639,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...she left the bucket.
640,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Want some?
641,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Don't mind if I do.
642,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...oh, mild-spice. Nice."
643,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Weird. Maybe she got a mixed-up order and that's why she left them here.
644,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,She usually orders stronger stuff?
645,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I've found buckets that make my throat itch just from being near them.
646,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh.
647,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm...
648,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Say, Jill. What kind of guys do you like?"
649,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That's a sudden question.
650,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I'm not too picky with guys, to be honest. I want them to be decent enough."
651,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not jealous, not aggressive, responsible enough to keep a job..."
652,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That's no good! Do you like them buff? What about tall?
653,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm...
654,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No tattoos or piercings, I guess. Never liked either."
655,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What about you?
656,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I like them well-dressed.
657,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"If they go out in ironed shirts and well-coordinated clothes, they're sure to catch my eye."
658,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...some muscle is always fine too. But sharply-dressed males catch my attention faster.
659,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And yet you're still single.
660,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,That's how I like my men. My potential husband on the other hand... is another matter completely.
661,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I see.
662,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, can you get me a drink here? The spicy wings turned out to be spicy."
663,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What do I get you?
664,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anything, as long as it helps me with the spiciness in my mouth."
665,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay.
666,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here.
667,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
668,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*phew*... it helped.
669,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Thanks.
670,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
671,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
672,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*cough*
673,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Not the most pleasant thing, but it helped."
674,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This might help.
675,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
676,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"*phew* Yup, it did."
677,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Thanks.
678,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
679,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
680,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,*COUGH* Damn...
681,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"No more spice, but I have other problems now."
682,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Here you go.
683,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
684,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Jill, I'm *this* close to throwing it in your face."
685,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Mission accomplished then.
686,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Alright, so. Next question."
687,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What kind of girl do you like?
688,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Ngh...
689,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hmhm...?
690,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Y-You first.
691,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sorry, I don't swing that way."
692,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sure, I have no qualms about saying a girl is cute or cool but..."
693,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Nope, I prefer men in my bed."
694,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Now you.
695,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"(Shit, just... calm down.)"
696,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I guess I like girls with light-colored hair.
697,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Light-colored hair?
698,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Y-Yeah, you know... like redheads and such."
699,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What about white? Like your boss?
700,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...you were just setting me up for that comment, weren't you?"
701,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sorry, it's just that when she got here with the bucket of wings, your eyes pretty much started sparkling."
702,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Your whole behavior transformed! You became giddy and cheerful all the sudden.
703,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
704,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey, I can't blame you. She's pretty nice."
705,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I just felt like teasing you.
706,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
707,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,So... light-colored hair.
708,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,What about blondes? Do you like me?
709,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yeah, I guess."
710,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Let's say I'm into girls too and I start hitting on you.
711,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Would you go along with it?
712,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Nice body, pretty face, and a good apartment? I wouldn't ever let you go."
713,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Heheh...
714,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Okay then. Enough tangents. Why don't you tell me why you were feeling shitty these last days?
715,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What? Oh... that.
716,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I told you not to think too much about it.
717,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,And I told you I wanna know!
718,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Come on, Jill! You've heard my problems so many times. Now I wanna help you."
719,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
720,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Come on, come here."
721,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Eh?
722,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I told you to sit here. Come on.
723,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,E-Eh? W-Wha-...
724,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What are you-...?
725,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Alright then. Now, I'm the bartender and you're the client."
726,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hardly. The bartending station only works with me.
727,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I see.
728,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Okay then, I move this here, click here and..."
729,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Now it works for you, for me, and that dog in a Hawaiian shirt."
730,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Why with him too?
731,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,He's a dog. In a fucking Hawaiian shirt.
732,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Right, and how did you even manage to..."
733,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, hacker. Right..."
734,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Now we've changed roles.
735,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You've been feeling shitty. Mind telling me why?
736,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's... a long story. I don't even know where to start.
737,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Start from the beginning.
738,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
739,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Okay then. It's something that goes back to my college years.
740,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Whoa, that's taking it way back."
741,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back in compulsory education, I never made too much of an effort but I managed to get high grades."
742,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Even in P.E., I managed to do well enough to always get perfect grades."
743,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And then, of course, when I got to college, shit started getting hard."
744,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I had this perfectionist streak that wouldn't let me fail anything.
745,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Burning my eyelashes studying, I eventually managed to keep up good grades."
746,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"After about half of the career, I met a student teacher. Her name was Lenore."
747,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She helped me a lot with my studies. She even got me into stuff that gave more credits.
748,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I really liked her, and after some time I found out she liked me too."
749,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Ohoho...
750,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"We started going out, I met all of her family even, and-..."
751,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You want a drink?
752,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,What?
753,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"A drink. Around this time, there's usually a pause that makes you offer a drink to the client."
754,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,There was no such pause.
755,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Please! I wanna test this whole bartending interface.
756,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* A Sugar Rush then, you can't mess that up."
757,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Right!
758,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Here!
759,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
760,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,How is it?
761,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Like I said, you can't mess up a Sugar Rush."
762,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hmph...
763,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Here!
764,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
765,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...this is for giving you that drink before, right?"
766,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Revenge is a drink best dispensed spicy.
767,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Here.
768,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
769,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...so?
770,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"No Sugar Rush, but this doesn't look like it'll blow up."
771,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I have this gut feeling that with your body, you'd make a better bartender than me."
772,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"You're selling yourself too short. You're cute, you know?"
773,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,People don't go to bars for cuteness though...
774,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You've obviously never been to a Catbar then.
775,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Besides, my boobs can be a hassle when trying to move around this kind of stuff."
776,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, keep telling the story."
777,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
778,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, as the career went on and on, it got harder and harder."
779,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The last year and a half of it became nothing but study session after study session, investigations, my thesis..."
780,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"When the graduation ceremony came, I had to make a speech and suddenly, while reading said speech..."
781,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I almost had a panic attack.
782,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Fear of public speaking?
783,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I realised I lost about a year and a half of my life.
784,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I tried to remember if I did anything fun at all, but all I could remember was studying and investigating new topics."
785,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I didn't even enjoy doing all that. So, I was just standing there and the satisfaction of graduating was minimal."
786,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I realized I had only gone through the motions, day after day. From high school to graduating."
787,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I-I... felt like whole years of my life had slipped through my fingers.
788,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I never stopped to think if I enjoyed what I was doing... in fact, I never stopped."
789,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"But at that point, I stopped... and realized I needed a breather or something."
790,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Did I even like that career? It was all terrifying as hell.
791,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I needed all of my strength to not start running like a panicked mess.
792,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Hm...
793,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
794,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,*sigh*
795,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"So, a couple of months later, I get an offer to start working at this big research facility."
796,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Lenore was ecstatic. She was so proud of me back then.
797,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...but I was just scared.
798,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,That would be my job. I'd spend my life expanding on what I did during that year and a half.
799,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"What if I had a sudden realization like the one I had at graduation, but when I turned 40?"
800,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I didn't know what to do, but I sure as hell wasn't taking that offer."
801,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I told Lenore and she freaked out. She confessed that she was jealous because she never got such a chance.
802,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Things devolved pretty quickly. She said one too many things, I said one too many things..."
803,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"In the end I just stormed out of her house, and I broke a vase in the process."
804,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"After that, I never spoke to her again."
805,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Damn.
806,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'm sorry I...
807,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I suddenly feel bad for pushing you to tell me all that.
808,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Why are you feeling shitty about that after all this time, though?"
809,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Unless you've been feeling shitty for years.
810,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I have, but it's not just because of that."
811,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Eh?
812,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"The other day Lenore's sister, Gabrielle, came to this bar."
813,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...apparently Lenore died last week.
814,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
815,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Localized Nanomachine Rejection. A heart attack.
816,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Apparently, she had it for a long time, but never told anyone."
817,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...and coincidentally, it got worse after I left."
818,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And I just can't stop thinking about it. Wondering if me being there would've made a difference.
819,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And if it's true she had that for a long time, why didn't she tell me she was sick when we were together?"
820,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I don't know, I just feel... like all kinds of failure."
821,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
822,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Jill...
823,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And to make it worse, I also lashed out at Gaby."
824,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yes, she was blaming me for her sister's death and all but..."
825,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She's just a kid, for fuck's sake. She lost the sister who pretty much raised her on her own."
826,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...and to top it all off, I suddenly can't remember what stopped me from apologizing."
827,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Pride? Fear? A stupid effort to leave the most awesome person I loved as a thing of the past?
828,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Who cares?! I lost my chance to apologize to her forever. Truly forever.
829,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'm such a piece of shit...
830,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,A selfish... piece of shit.
831,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
832,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I honestly don't know what to say.
833,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I... didn't expect the story to be this...
834,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I...
835,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
836,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Yo, Boobtender."
837,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Y-Yes?!
838,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Can you get me a big Beer here?
839,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,C-Coming right up!
840,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Big Beer for Jill.
841,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Thanks.
842,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I need to remember to take care of the cans in my apartment.
843,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Do you drink lots of Beer?
844,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,One of the perks of the BTC-issued liver implant is that I can drink lots of Beer without getting too wasted.
845,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Ooooh.
846,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,One Beer.
847,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Not a big one, though."
848,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You sure those glasses of yours work?
849,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Well, I do need to get them checked but..."
850,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Nevermind. Sorry for the mistake.
851,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Here.
852,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,This isn't a Beer.
853,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Alma, you do know what a Beer is, right?"
854,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Drank so much of it in college I might not know anymore, actually."
855,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
856,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Hey Jill, what kind of girl was Lenore?"
857,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Hm? Well...
858,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She was... calm, and smart."
859,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back in college, I was too thick-headed and got riled up easily. ""Stressed"" was my default state."
860,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"So, just like you're behaving right now."
861,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up. I was worse.
862,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Can't picture that.
863,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Don't. It's embarrassing.
864,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Anyway, she was always there, finding a way to cool me down."
865,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,She was also able to hold conversations about pretty much any topic.
866,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"One time, I saw her go from talking about video games to talking about sports."
867,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,All of that variety while still being a hardcore scientist.
868,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She would always push me into social interactions. If she saw me by myself, she would drag me with her."
869,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"""Watching people is fine, but talking to them is better,"" she would say."
870,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Lenore would always present me to her many acquaintances as ""the girl I don't mind cuddling with for hours""."
871,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"*sigh* Man, I'm gonna miss her."
872,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"After a point, I didn't even think about getting back into a relationship with her, but..."
873,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She was such an awesome person, I just wanted to apologize."
874,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,And now...
875,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...*sigh*
876,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You know... in a cruel twist of irony, she's the one that made me pick up bartending."
877,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Oh?
878,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Back when I was thinking what the hell to do with my life, I remembered a night we spent in a club."
879,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She started talking about how the drinks were synthesized, the chemistry involved, the reactions and all that."
880,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Everything sounded so fascinating. I remember saying that her talk made me want to start mixing drinks.
881,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"She said ""If everything else fails, why not take up bartending?"""
882,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Huh... interesting.
883,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
884,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...
885,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Are you okay?
886,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"For some value of ""okay"", yeah."
887,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It's just...
888,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I wanted to thank you, Alma."
889,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,T-Thank me?
890,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I guess I just needed someone to tell all of this to. And you were the one.
891,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,You volunteered yourself. You insisted on listening to me.
892,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"You stood there, listening to the whole thing from beginning to end."
893,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I know I might not be the most expressive person, that I'm not one to spout love and fluffiness, but..."
894,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I really like you.
895,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Maybe I'm just a bartender and you're just a client...
896,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...but I really appreciate your friendship, or at the very least your patronage."
897,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I really enjoy working for you.
898,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,...
899,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"...Jill, are you dying?"
900,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Shut up! I'm trying to have a heart to heart here!
901,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Sorry, sorry. It's just..."
902,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's weird for you to get so... sappy.
903,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Well, I just realized that the saddest thing is how I'll never be able to make amends..."
904,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And it hurts like fucking hell, you know."
905,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I never, and I mean NEVER, wanna feel that way ever again."
906,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't want someone to suddenly exit my life and have my last memory of them involve something nasty.
907,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't want the lingering grief of having burned a bridge on a whim.
908,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I want to avoid that at any cost. And if it means breaking character every once in a while, so be it."
909,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I'll let everyone know how I really feel about them.
910,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"And if I ever fight with them, I'll swallow my pride, muster all the courage I can and be the one to apologize."
911,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I hate feeling like this. Hate it! Hate it!!
912,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Heheh, that's a nice resolution. Maybe I'll be a copycat and do the same."
913,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"...alright, enough sappiness, get back here. I'm on duty, you know?"
914,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Fiiiiiiiiiiiiine.
915,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It's almost closing time anyways.
916,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,It was fun while it lasted though.
917,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,...hey.
918,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Yeah?
919,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"I-I mean it, you know? Thanks for everything today."
920,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Silly Jill. You listened to my problems and I listened to yours. That's what friends are for, right?"
921,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right...
922,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,I'll be leaving now... Oh! Before I forget.
923,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Did you ever talk about all this with your parents?
924,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"They know the basics, but I haven't told them about Lenore's death yet."
925,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,Why don't you do that sometime?
926,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,I don't know. I don't want to bother them with my problems...
927,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Don't be silly, they're your parents. They live to share your problems."
928,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,You should try having a talk like this with them sometime. They'll appreciate it.
929,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Alma,"Anyway, I'm out. See you on Sunday!"
930,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Take care.
931,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,That Alma girl sure is nice.
932,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Ah Boss, d-did you hear all that?"
933,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Not all of it, but a good chunk, at the very least."
934,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Your expression changed a lot already.
935,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,It did?
936,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,You look happier. That's always good.
937,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"Anyway, let's call it a day. I expect an even brighter Jill tomorrow."
938,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,Right!
939,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Jill,"Oh yeah, Boss. About those chicken wings..."
940,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,Fucking idiots at the Spicy Chicken...
941,undefined,undefined,dialogue,Dana,"""Sorry Dana, we won't have enough spices for your order until tomorrow."" they said."
